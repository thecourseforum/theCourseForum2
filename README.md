[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/thecourseforum/theCourseForum2.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/thecourseforum/theCourseForum2)

2020 Django rewrite of theCourseForum website

[Staging](http://thecourseforum-staging.herokuapp.com/) | [Dev](http://thecourseforum-dev.herokuapp.com/)

# Setup
## MacOS and Linux Setup
1. Install git, docker, and docker-compose
    - https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git
    - https://docs.docker.com/install/
    - https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/
2. Clone the git repository and cd into the project folder
    ```
        git clone https://github.com/thecourseforum/theCourseForum2.git
        cd theCourseForum2
    ```
3. Copy the [project secret keys](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HsuJOf-5oZljQK_k02CQhFbqw1q-pD_1-mExvyC1TV0/edit?usp=sharing) into a `.env` file in the project base directory `theCourseForum2/`
4. In the `theCourseForum2/` directory, run these commands to start your Docker container:
    ```
        cp .env.example .env        # See *note below
        docker build .
        docker-compose up
    ```
5. Download a copy of the database from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ubiiOj-jfzoBKaMK6pFEkFXdSqMuD-22)
    - put this into the base `theCourseForum2/` directory
6. While your container is still running, open a second terminal, cd into `theCourseForum2/`, and run the following command to set up your database (you may need to run it 3 times if you see errors, and you may still see errors after that, but it'll work)\*:

    - \*`cat april7.sql | docker exec -i tcf_db psql -U tcf_django tcf_db`
7. Go to http://localhost:8000 in your browser and make sure everything works!

\*This method can also work if you have a version of Windows that is supported by Docker Desktop â€” i.e. Windows 10 Pro, Enterprise, or Education, but NOT Home (the most common version). However, you'll have to run `cp` and `cat` in a bash shell (ex. PowerShell, Git Bash) because those commands don't exist in CMD.

## Alternative Setup (Windows and MacOS if above failed)
0. [Install Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/intro/getting-started/install.html)
1. `git clone https://github.com/thecourseforum/theCourseForum2.git`
2. Go into the `theCourseForum2/` folder and then run `vagrant up` to start a VM.
3. After that's booted, run `vagrant ssh` to run commands inside the VM.
4. `cd /vagrant`
5. Start at step 3 in normal setup. You may have to prefix all docker commands with `sudo` (e.g. `sudo docker-compose up`).
6. Go to http://127.0.0.1:8000 and make sure it works!
7. Run `vagrant` suspend when you're done to suspend the VM.


# How to Contribute
If you are part of theCourseForum engineering team, follow the instructions below to create a PR for your feature branch. If you are a UVA student and would like to contribute, contact one of the current contributors.

## Directions
1. Create a new branch to do your work in off of the `dev` branch.
    - `git pull`
    - `git checkout dev`
    - `git checkout -B your_branch_name`
2. Make your changes!
3. Write unit tests and put them in `tcf_website/tests/`
4. Lint and test locally before commit:
    - `./precommit`
    - Fix any problems indicated by tests or pylint or eslint.
    - To fix eslint errors, you may need to do one of the following in JS files (just to give a few examples):
      - explicitly export functions (`no-unused-vars`)
      - explicitly import functions or declare variable with `let` (`no-undef`)
      - replace double equals (`==`) with triple equals (`===`) (`eqeqeq`)
      - change snake_case to to camelCase (`camelcase`)
4. Stage your changes with `git add .`
5. Commit with `git commit -m "Add X feature."`
6. Push! `git push`
7. Make a Pull Request to merge your changes back into `dev`.
8. Wait for all tests to pass.
9. Request an approver.
10. Wait to be approved and merged!

## Design Philosophies
- Thick models, thin views, thinner templates
    - most application logic should be in methods on model classes.
        - this ensures that the code can be reused easily anywhere the model is used and is way easier to test.
    - furthermore, you should avoid placing logic in templates.
        - e.g. don't filter lists in templates, filter them in the views.


## Common Issues & Fixes

### Database Issues
If the 'Browse Courses' page isn't loading, try the following:
1. Check to see if postgres is running by running `ps auxwww | grep postgres` in your terminal
    - If it outputs only one line, postgres is not running. Restart it with Homebrew: `brew services start postgresql`.
2. There may be a Django migration issue. Exec into your container and re-migrate:
```
docker-compose exec web bash
python3 manage.py makemigrations
python3 manage.py migrate
```
3. If all else fails, reset the development database by dropping the table and re-running the Setup instructions.
```
dropdb [DEV_DB_NAME];
createdb [DEV_DB_NAME];
```

### Django Migration Conflicts
After we removed the migrations folder from the `.gitignore` file, you may experience migration issues when you merge different branches where the models (database tables/columns) have been modified. Try the following to resolve the issue:

#### Local Development:
1. Delete everything in tcf_website/migrations EXCEPT for `__init__.py`.
    - If you accidentally delete this file, recreate an empty file with the same name. Migrations will not update without this file.
2. Delete everything in your `__pycache__` directories
3. While your container for the Django application is running, re-run migrations commands below:
```
docker-compose exec web bash
python3 manage.py makemigrations
python3 manage.py migrate
```
4. If all else fails, reset the development database by dropping the table and re-running the Database Setup instructions.
```
dropdb [DEV_DB_NAME];
createdb [DEV_DB_NAME];
```


# Website Update Plans/Guides

## Data migration plan from tCF 1.0 (total downtime: 2.5 hours)
1. Get latest copy of legacy db using `mysqldump` from DO instance.
2. Convert to sqlite using `legacy_db/mysql2sqlite`
    - Then put in `settings.py` as database `legacy`
3. `docker exec -it tcf_django bash` and then `python manage.py migrate_legacy_subdepartments`
4. `python manage.py load_all_semesters`
5. `python manage.py migrate_legacy_reviews`
6. `docker exec tcf_db pg_dump -U tcf_django -Fc tcf_db > dump.pgsql`
7. Test
    - Maybe crawl tCF and check that all viewable reviews are on the new system.
8. Upload to DigitalOcean DB.
    - `PGPASSWORD=$DB_PASS pg_restore -U $DB_USER -h $DB_HOST -p 25060 -d $DB_NAME < dump.pgsql`
    - You may have to run this command 3 times.

## New semester update plan
1. `python manage.py update_semester 2021 january`
    - fetches CSV from lous list
    - loads section data into database
        - update courses with new course info if available
        - create new instructors if needed
