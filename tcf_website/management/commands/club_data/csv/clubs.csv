We strive to make personal finance interactive, engaging, and appealing for a wide audience. Regardless of age, major, career, or income level, we seek to break the stigma and fear of personal finance and improve financial literacy. This organization was first launched at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School and has expanded to other colleges such as Cornell, Johns Hopkins, and Florida State. After meeting with national leadership from UPenn, we were approved to start our own chapter at the University of Virginia. We now have an executive committee, approximately 30 members signed up, and Professor Dorothy Kelly of the McIntire School of Commerce as our faculty advisor. Our mission is to promote financial literacy both at UVA and in the wider Charlottesville community. At UVA, many undergraduate students lack basic personal finance skills necessary to live on their own. For example, too many 1st year students sign leases for 2nd year between September and October without fully understanding their rights or obligations under the expensive leases that local landlords make them sign. In addition, many sign up for credit cards and student loans, taking on debt for the first time, which leads to financial challenges early in their lives. It is our goal to promote financial literacy through guest speakers, lectures, and interactive activities. The need for financial literacy and personal finance basics is not only essential for UVA undergraduates, but extends to the local community. We want to help young people, minority groups and recent immigrants in the greater Charlottesville region similarly learn to better understand personal finance. This is why we are looking to partner with local high schools and Piedmont Virginia Community College to help promote financial literacy through presentations from Common Cents club members and to better prepare them for the financial decisions they will need to make in the near future.

Hypersonic ReEntry Deployable Glider Experiment at UVA,Academic & Professional,Contracted Independent Organization (CIO)$Academic & Professional,True,"The Hypersonic ReEntry Deployable Glider Experiment (HEDGE) is an exciting student-led engineering project that began as a capstone project at the University of Virginia. Our goal is to break down the high-cost barriers typically associated with hypersonic research by designing and launching an innovative, low-cost experiment. Using a CubeSAT framework, we’re proving that impactful aerospace research doesn’t need multi-million-dollar budgets.Scheduled to launch in August 2025 this year and in future years through NASA’s RockSat-X program at Wallops Flight Facility, HEDGE is more than a technical experiment—it’s a once-in-a-lifetime educational experience for undergraduate aerospace engineering students. Together, we’ve developed a system that will collect crucial real-time data on hypersonic reentry dynamics, using a modular design that can serve as a model for affordable research by academic and small-scale institutions.One of HEDGE’s biggest innovations is its ability to connect to the Iridium Constellation Satellite mid-flight to transmit real-time data to a ground station at UVA. This live telemetry will provide insights into temperature, pressure, position, and aerodynamic performance, allowing us to evaluate the experiment’s success in real-time. Additionally, we’ve equipped the rocket with a camera to record the deployment of the glider. This video will let us verify if we’ve overcome a major challenge faced by past HEDGE teams: the successful deployment of aerodynamic fins. These two features—live data transmission and real-time footage—give our team the tools to achieve breakthroughs where others have struggled.But HEDGE isn’t just about technical success—it’s also about empowering students. Our team is learning through hands-on experience, using industry-standard tools like MATLAB, SolidWorks, and Ansys, and tackling real-world challenges in aerospace design and testing. This project simulates what it’s like to work in the aerospace industry, providing invaluable lessons in collaboration, problem-solving, and communication. Students are also guided by faculty mentors and industry professionals, gaining connections and insights that will help launch their careers.HEDGE is supported by UVA’s Department of Engineering, which provides credibility, resources, and opportunities to share our story. In fact, one of the most exciting parts of this journey is the potential for outreach: we plan to share our progress through articles and publications, raising awareness about the possibilities of low-cost hypersonic research and inspiring others to follow in our footsteps. This exposure not only highlights the groundbreaking work of our team but also shows how projects like this can prepare students to make meaningful contributions to the aerospace field.At its core, HEDGE is about making hypersonic research more accessible. By using a CubeSAT platform and innovative design strategies, we’ve created an experiment that can collect high-value data during reentry—at speeds of up to Mach 4.88—without the massive price tag. This modular, scalable approach can open doors for other universities and organizations to explore hypersonic research, breaking down barriers and democratizing access to this critical area of aerospace innovation. HEDGE is a not only unique project focused not only on a low-cost CubeSAT launch, but an investment in the next generation of aerospace professionals. Backed by UVA’s Department of Engineering and connected to NASA’s RockSat-X program, HEDGE offers a unique opportunity to make an impact on both education and research. Together, we can inspire change, create opportunities, and take an important step toward making hypersonic research more accessible for everyone.",b6e80245-3992-4226-9cce-7c3fbfbec45d.png

In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience.  These events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event.  TEDx at UVA put on its first event in April 2012 and has hosted a conference every year since.  Our conference includes students, professors, and outside professionals as speakers.  Members of TEDx do not speak at our events, we are in different teams that work towards organizing our conference.  Below are descriptions of each committee:Speakers: Members of the Speakers Committee recruit, organize, and oversee all speakers of our TEDx conferences. In the Fall, the Speakers Committee will mentor student speakers; this involves editing TED talks (strong writing skills necessary), writing and responding to emails efficiently, and providing advice to student speakers in a one-on-one mentoring setting. In the spring, members of Speakers are responsible for recruiting TEDx speakers and mentoring them in writing their TED talks. Members of the committee must be comfortable communicating in a professional and prompt manner and will be working in a very small group setting.Sponsorship: The Sponsorship Committee handles the sourcing and using of the organization's funds. As a member of the Sponsorship Team, you will be involved in developing and managing the club's budget, applying for grants and managing relationships with corporate partners, and creating ways to find and use funds strategically. The role is perfect for someone with an interest in finance and gives you a very unique view of the club's operation and management.Outreach: The job of this committee would broadly be to engage with the University community in ways other than Student Speaker Conference and the Main Conference. This would entail the continued publication of a newsletter for the TEDx community as well as collaborations with other groups on grounds to promote ideas worth spreading. The exciting thing about this committee is that it acts nearly independently and requires creativity, allowing the members to have a huge amount of latitude in the direction of the committee.Graphics and Marketing:The role of the Graphics committee is to facilitate communication between the organization and the University community. Members of this committee will be responsible for managing social media accounts, our website, and our on-Ground presence through flyering, chalking, and creating outreach videos. In addition, committee members will be creating graphics through various software programs, developing ideas, and producing various marketing campaigns to be implemented on-Grounds for TEDx sponsored events.Logistics: The logistics committee is concerned with the behind the scenes of the two conferences. Being on this committee involves creating the decorations, designing the stage, and organizing venues. Logistics members need to have a strong sense of design, communication, and organizational skills in order to make the conferences run smoothly.

We delve into the rock/punk/pop band music through sessions that not only cover the fundamentals of band management, such as basic instrument setup, amplifier types needed, band promotion strategies, and performance preparation but also emphasize the importance of each instrument's role in music production. Our vision includes nurturing musical bands within the University of Virginia community to enhance the student body's appreciation for ensemble music as a form of collaborative art, by covering band music, and writing original songs. What we offerWe host sessions that dive deep into rock/punk band music. From band management to music production, our sessions intend to be informative and creative. In band management sessions, we cover the basic instrumental setup of bands, the types of amplifiers needed, ways to advertise one’s band, and what to prepare before a performance. We teach the basic skills required to become a professional band manager. In music production sessions, our core members will take turns giving mini-lectures on the instruments they are familiar with. Rather than teaching these instruments from scratch, the mini-lectures focus on the role of each instrument in band music production. Besides, we will go over how instruments work together to achieve various sound effects through the analysis of popular songs.Besides, members interested in performing will perform at community music events as a band throughout the year. Each year, we will produce about 5 original songs as an organization. The performing members will rehearse twice a month to prepare for two performances each semester. We welcome students interested in expanding their prior experience in instruments to music production in a band setting. We also welcome those who desire to learn how popular bands operate on the business side.  Future PlansOur vision for the club's future encompasses several ambitious objectives.Initially, our goal is to nurture the development of musical bands within the University of Virginia, aiming to broaden the student body's appreciation for the collaborative art of ensemble music. We advocate for the perception of a band as not merely a collective of instrumentalists but as a microcosm encapsulating a community, and indeed, a familial spirit. Participating in a band transcends the simple mastery of musical instruments; it involves cultivating profound interpersonal relationships among members, alongside acquiring the skills necessary for effective group management and motivation towards realizing a shared vision. Our interest extends beyond the music itself to encompass the dynamics of human interaction and the essence of band culture.Furthermore, we are committed to enhancing our contribution to the broader community through multifaceted initiatives. We recognize the transformative power of music and its capacity to serve as a force for societal benefit. Our overarching project aims to envision bands as entities capable of transcending musical performance, engaging in advocacy for marginalized societal groups, and leveraging their talents to foster joy and empowerment. We aspire to utilize our musical endeavors to support charitable causes, organize concerts dedicated to those in need, and ultimately, reinvest in our community with a spirit of generosity and compassion.",34ddd3da-e68b-407e-82fa-45bc55ec1489.png

Virginia Journal of International Law,Identity & Culture,Contracted Independent Organization (CIO)$Academic & Professional$Law School$Media & Publications$International,True,"The Virginia Journal of International Law is one of the top ranked international law journals in the world. Founded in 1960, we are located at the University of Virginia School of Law in Charlottesville, Virginia. We publish three times annually, and our issues contain Articles, Notes, and Essays. We also host an annual symposium.For an overview of who we are, where we've been, and our contributions to the field of international law, please read then-Dean Paul Mahoney's commemorative letter from the fiftieth anniversary Volume in 2010, copied below:&#34;We are all internationalists now. Fifty years ago, when the Virginia Journal of International Law began publication, international law was a narrowly-defined field concerned with the legal obligations of nation states vis-à-vis one another. International law scholars had relatively little to say to their domestic law counterparts and vice versa. Scholars of comparative law, although engaged in an analytically different exercise, shared much of the culture of international lawyers and published in the same journals, including VJIL. Today the barriers between international and domestic law are diminishing. In part, this is a simple result of the dramatic growth in cross-border movements of people and capital. But it is also, interestingly, a consequence of intellectual and cultural conflict between international and domestic law. Reflecting its origins, international law has a decidedly European sensibility. That sensibility is frequently out of step with American domestic law on matters relating to war, criminal punishment, the environment, and so on. It therefore matters whether international law limits or informs domestic law on those issues. In recent years, U.S. courts have partly opened the door to such influence. Barring a reversal of that trend or a substantial cultural shift on one side of the Atlantic or the other, the underlying policy conflicts will guarantee increasing debate between international and domestic law scholars. The era when each could ignore the other’s substantive commitments is over. A third reason for the convergence is methodological. International and comparative scholars were relative latecomers to the interdisciplinary movement in legal scholarship. More recently, international law scholars have come to rely on insights from international relations theory, which is in turn informed by game theory and institutional economics. The methodological distance between international law and domestic law scholarship, which widened with the creation of “law and” movements in the middle of the last century, has narrowed again. If international law scholars found political science and economics, we might say that economics found comparative law. In the past decade there has been an explosion of empirical work in macroeconomics that looks for the determinants of cross-country differences in the organization and operation of the economy. A striking conclusion of that literature is that the design of a country’s legal system is strongly related to the organization of its financial, product, and labor markets. This has sparked an outpouring of interest among economists in the differences among legal systems. Comparative law scholars have not been entirely welcoming of this interest, but here too it seems clear that the barriers separating comparative law and previously domestically-focused law and economics are breaking down. We can see the results in the pages of recent issues of VJIL, which discuss financial and environmental regulation, intellectual property, antitrust, and taxation, each only dimly on the minds of internationalists fifty years ago. This widening of the interests and concerns of international and comparative law is healthy and bodes well for the intellectual promise of VJIL’s next fifty years. VJIL has been a major forum for the development of scholarly ideas about international and comparative law over the past fifty years, and I congratulate the Journal and its editors, past and present, for their contribution to the advancement of those fields. I have no doubt that the future will be equally bright.&#34;",5979e72b-7bb9-48ed-ba92-8ffcdc64ae30.jpg
