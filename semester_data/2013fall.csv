The project goal is to develop ecological, prefabricated and affordable house prototypes for low-income families. Over the next several years, interdisciplinary teams of UVA students and faculty are designing and building several 600 to 1,400 square foot housing units.  The completed homes are being evaluated carefully. The results of these efforts will directly influence later designs. The objective of the seminar is to analyze the third project, using the building monitoring, life cycle assessments, post occupancy evaluations and an affordability analysis. The course is open to graduate as well as 3rd and 4th year undergraduates from any program at the university. In particular, the instructor is hoping for a mix of architecture, landscape architecture, historic preservation, planning, economics, business and environmental science students. Engineering students will be enrolled in a separate course, led by engineering professor Paxton Marshall.

Movie projects may range in creative subject areas. Built and landscape architectural places may be experienced according to our own changing eye point of view, the transformation of light and objects, as well as the movement of other people. Story telling, whether by means of simple character animation or more complex scene description, may related to these contextual aspects of either real or imagined environments.

A range of enterprises are examined from early stage (venture capital) to late stage (mezzanine financing and buyouts) to provide perspective on how the maturity of an organization influences the nature and structure of financing and valuation. Issues related to the measurement of returns in private equity funds, valuing enterprises at different stages of development, and structuring deals using various forms of financing are covered as well as the analytical methods to better measure performance and value enterprises. Students will examine how each party's view of the value of the enterprise forms a basis for negotiation upon which the percentage of equity participation and the terms of the contract are determined as well as how the pricing and terms depend not only the deal itself but also upon prevailing market conditions. As private equity firms are either rapidly growing or changing organizations, students will learn that there must be sufficient flexibility and appropriate incentives built into the current round of capital raising and the contract terms to carry the firm through its next stage of development."

The name of the course accurately describes its contents: strategic management of organizations that create and deliver financial products. There are several reasons for studying the strategic management challenges of financial service organizations. First, this aspect of financial service organizations management has been the make-or-break decision for financial service organizations in recent years. Some segments of the financial service industry end up with capital needs, and others find themselves with surplus but expensive capital. Either problem can be fatal. Once the strategy has been selected, however, the implementation decisions, although not necessarily the implementation itself, are comparatively straightforward. Second, the strategic perspective permits the course much broader scope than would the alternative of concentrating in depth on a narrower set of institutions in order to cover all aspects of management. Broad perspective is also important for the course to make the maximum contribution to the career decisions of students considering jobs with financial service organizations, institutions that are not as closely examined in the corporate-finance focus of the first-year curriculum."

In this full-semester course, students prepare for the challenges posed by the increased use of teams in the workplace while working directly with first-year learning teams as the teams evolve throughout the first semester. The relationship formed with a student's first-year team and documented through weekly required observations becomes a live and continuing case throughout the term. The first part of the course focuses on the learning team's evolution, supplemented by ongoing delivery of relevant group theory. The second part of the course broadens the focus to include the contemporary issues and challenges of workplace teams, such as leading your group at work, managing coordinating teams in strategic alliances, and teaching others to be better team members. The course is most successful when students commit the time and energy needed to maintain weekly contact with their team and remain open to learning about themselves and others in the process."
