The balancing of environmental and economic costs and benefits, coupled with human beliefs about what is 'right' or 'wrong,' is at the heart of the environmental decision-making process. The process is complex because it involves a diverse set of stakeholders with differing perspectives and objectives.

Prerequisite: A graduate level or advanced undergraduate course in each of the following: Atmospheric Sciences, Ecology and Hydrology or permission of the instructor."

The course begins with an overview of the foundational topics of the American legal system: the law of contracts, property, and torts. It then moves to substantive areas that managers routinely encounter, such as corporate governance, bankruptcy, intellectual property, and antitrust. The course examines the structure of the court systems and legal profession in the United States and provides some comparative analysis of other legal systems.

The name of the course accurately describes its contents: strategic management of organizations that create and deliver financial products. There are several reasons for studying the strategic management challenges of financial service organizations. First, this aspect of financial service organizations management has been the make-or-break decision for financial service organizations in recent years. Some segments of the financial service industry end up with capital needs, and others find themselves with surplus but expensive capital. Either problem can be fatal. Once the strategy has been selected, however, the implementation decisions, although not necessarily the implementation itself, are comparatively straightforward. Second, the strategic perspective permits the course much broader scope than would the alternative of concentrating in depth on a narrower set of institutions in order to cover all aspects of management. Broad perspective is also important for the course to make the maximum contribution to the career decisions of students considering jobs with financial service organizations, institutions that are not as closely examined in the corporate-finance focus of the first-year curriculum."

New methodology will treat risk preference, risk management, correlated variables and scenarios, risk exposure, dynamic uncertainty models, Optquest for optimization within simulation models, and the decision quality process used in decision consulting. Students will use Excel and a number of add-in software products."
21508,GBUS,8910,001,Lecture,"1.5","","","","Managerial Quantitative Analysis","",Open,0,65,0,"This course will review, reinforce, and extend the basic concepts gained from the required Decision Analysis course, such as spreadsheet construction, simulation, regression, decision trees, and optimization. The two primary objectives of the course are to improve students' basic analytical skills and to strengthen their ability to integrate quantitative analysis into their general decision-making process. This course and Management Decision Models are intended for students interested in further core Decision Analysis instruction and is designed for those students who were comfortable with Decision Analysis and wish to pick up where it left off without significant overlap. Students who feel the need for significant review and reinforcement of the Decision Analysis content with modest extensions will benefit from this course. Thus, those students who made an A or B+ in Decision Analysis probably will find that this course does not meet your educational objectives and should consider a course that is more appropriate. Please contact the instructor if you have questions in this regard."
