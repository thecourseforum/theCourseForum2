Students also are required to attend presentations of other students and to participate in group discussions. In addition to research presentations by students, there will also be presentations by faculty members in areas of significance for training of physician scientists. Grading (S/U) will be based on the quality of the students' presentation, as well as the extent of their participation in group discussions."

Although students pursuing these career paths do not need tax expertise, they do need to be able to evaluate critically when to call in the tax experts and what the tax experts are telling them. Therefore this course provides a general understanding of the basic tax consequences of fundamental restructuring strategies and a framework for evaluating the priority that taxes have in these strategies. The course requires students to analyze how tax consequences affect the value of different strategies to the buyer and seller. Understanding the effect of taxes on the value of a deal to the buyer and seller prepares future financial executives and strategic advisors to make better decisions and to be more effective negotiators. Although the course focuses on the tax consequences of restructuring strategies and their valuation implications, it also covers the nontax advantages and disadvantages of these strategies. Most of the course covers U.S. federal income tax issues of restructuring of C corporations, but it also will address pass-through entities. Other topics will be entity formation, taxable asset and stock acquisitions, tax-free asset and stock reorganizations, and divestitures and liquidations.

This course draws from cognitive science-based research on how expert entrepreneurs think, decide, and act while starting new ventures. Key issues addressed will include risk perception and management, formulation of innovative stakeholder relationships, and the creation of new markets through new ventures. As part of the course, students will be required to come up with a venture idea and take the initial steps in actually starting it.

In the course, students will discover that the issues, challenges, and perspectives differ as much as the numbers in the financials as well as what happens after the start-up or acquisition of a firm. Typical issues addressed are finding a job with a smaller enterprise, the characteristics of the smaller enterprise, creating value as a smaller enterprise CEO, management transitions associated with stages of small business growth, challenges of finding, retaining, and losing employees, special issues and considerations in the family-owned business, franchising as a financing and growth mechanism, import-export operations and international dimensions of small business, ethical challenges of everyday life in the small firm, the balancing act of personal, family, and business realities of the smaller firm, and exiting a venture on your terms."

Understanding the relative nature of this dynamic process is the key to building and sustaining competitive advantage. The seminar is designed to develop an appreciation for cutting-edge academic research and its application to pertinent competitive issues, which is an essential skill for managers responsible for developing and implementing business strategies and for consultants advising such managers. Participants will be expected to abstract larger strategic issues from financial and operational particulars and to apply the concepts, analytical tools, and research methods learned in class to an intensive project on competition. The course will be especially useful to those interested in strategy consulting, marketing and strategic planning, and industry security analysis, as well as anyone seeking to develop sophisticated competitive thinking.

It examines competitive situations from a diverse range of corporate activities in which performance depends on the interactions between a multiplicity of decision makers, including customers, suppliers, competitors, employees, managers, investors, and regulators. Students will develop a tool set for perceiving, analyzing, and shaping these interactions. Most of the tools have first been developed in economic game theory. Many key insights from game theory are intuitively compelling and fit literally on the back of an envelope. The course therefore emphasizes concepts and qualitative reasoning, rather than quantitative techniques. Case studies from different functional areas serve to provide students with a store of strategic insights and, under the guidance of analytical tools, to condition sound intuitive thinking that will carry over to new, unfamiliar problems. Computer simulations enable hands-on decision making and provide feedback on the effectiveness of personal rules of thumb for competitive interactions."

The valuation tools considered begin with basic arbitrage relationships and from there students will develop the Black-Scholes model. The course will also introduce the binomial approach and will use it as the primary valuation framework throughout the course.

Although this course does not guarantee that every student will become a change agent or provide a step-by-step path for executing such change, our belief is that the Washington, D.C. and Northern Virginia corridor as an intersection of technology, capital providers, government agencies and officials, small and large firms, and universities provides a fertile environment for study.

The resolution of this tension creates a dilemma for investment professionals. Some may choose to blindly accept theory and ignore the real-world realities of the market place. Others may choose to casually dismiss financial theory as unrealistic and irrelevant. Because either of these responses is likely to be perilous, this course seeks to fill the need for a more balanced response. Students may begin the course understanding that traditional finance theory relies on a set of fundamental assumptions about the behavior of buyers and sellers of financial securities and conditions of the market in which they trade. This course surveys areas of common departure from the traditional assumptions of investor behavior and market conditions with a view to evaluating their impact on investment decision rules."

These include: building and maintaining strategic alliances and networks; furthering team creativity and innovation; fostering collaborative organizational cultures and working relationships; containing financial and human costs; and, ultimately, improving business results. While rooted in negotiation and conflict theory, this course will provide pragmatic and practical general management skills and should therefore be of interest to all students, regardless of their specific career or personal goals.

Students will discuss the challenges of communicating across boundaries to bridge the gap between the perceived 'creative' and 'business' functions. Cases studies will be utilized as well as projects designed either by the students themselves in a way that is helpful to their career or by guests involved in the course. The course will also stage creative encounters in which guests involved in media, entertainment, and sports engage students in the problems they face in their professional lives, encounters for which students will aim to find innovative solutions."

In this industry, whether Biotech or Devices, the consumer of products, the patient, does not choose the product, pay for it, or have any say about what products are available. This is a unique environment in which anyone involved needs to have a working knowledge of the philosophy, terminology, and processes their clients, companies, or products will have to follow. The course is not designed to make students regulatory experts but to show them ways to navigate the regulatory pathways and related issues, which impact every phase of the creation and growth of a Life Sciences company. For the most part, students will not examine the issues surrounding the growth of provider or service businesses such as hospitals but instead explore the issues related to businesses built around proprietary technology. Topic samples: the history and evolution of regulation in this country and why it has evolved differently in other countries; cosmetics, cosmeceuticals, and food and how these areas are coming under increasing scrutiny by regulators; how to finance a drug versus a device company; and emerging technologies' issues. Course content will include cases, class discussions, background reading, guest lectures, and individual and student team projects.

Students also will participate in a comprehensive review of nine analytical models. Each model is designed to foster robust thinking about experiential innovation and will be accompanied by a handful of typical examples, followed by open discussion and an interactive exercise aimed at making application to specific businesses and industries. At the conclusion of this review, teams will be formed with each team tasked with developing a case study or research report that utilizes a particular model to provide further exploration about creating value through new or enhanced experiences."

It also demonstrates why innovation is increasingly important, not only to technology companies but also to companies across a broad spectrum of industries. Through business cases and filmed interviews, students will examine companies and leaders that have been successful at building cultures of innovation. The course is intended for students who seek to lead a business organization. It may also be useful for students wishing to pursue an investment career, as identifying leadership that creates cultures of innovation is believed by many to be a key ingredient in successful investing.

The course material seldom will deal with high-tech enterprises that are purchased with the intent of rapid resale. On the contrary, it deals with companies operating in the mundane, real world of the typical small-enterprise owner who needs sales to meet the payroll, wisely uses limited capital resources, carefully raises new funds, and must plan for the ultimate transfer of the business to new owners. The latter problem is unique to the small, privately held business. In addition to considering typical issues of asset management, including acquisitions and dispositions, the course will cover topics such as working-capital management, selecting funding sources and structuring loans, project finance, creating liquidity, and transferring the business to the next generation or selling it.

10058,GBUS,8610,001,Lecture,"1.5","","","","Business to Business Marketing","",Open,0,65,0,"This course is designed primarily for students seeking a marketing career in organizations that market products and services to other organizations. While the course is aimed at those interested in business-to-business marketing, it is also appropriate for those seeking careers in consulting, manufacturing, and nonmarketing functional areas of business-to-business firms. The course emphasizes the tactical aspects of business marketing as well as conceptual and strategic elements of the marketing-planning process. The course begins by examining how to organize the marketing function and then moves to the topics of buyer-seller relationships, sales force management, complexities and problems inherent in forging longer term partnerships, and developing and managing complex distribution systems along with some exposure to product development and launch. Cases have been chosen from a variety of settings, ranging from high tech to 'metal bending' and from the emerging to the more mature businesses. As opportunities arise, the course will incorporate a 'live' case. Working with a company to address critical marketing problems, student teams will be assigned to work on these problems. These projects comprise the final project for the course and take the class work from the written-case analysis to the real-time case analysis. Topics for study are chosen based on the importance to the firm and on the relevance of the topic to the content of the course."

The name of the course accurately describes its contents: strategic management of organizations that create and deliver financial products. There are several reasons for studying the strategic management challenges of financial service organizations. First, this aspect of financial service organizations management has been the make-or-break decision for financial service organizations in recent years. Some segments of the financial service industry end up with capital needs, and others find themselves with surplus but expensive capital. Either problem can be fatal. Once the strategy has been selected, however, the implementation decisions, although not necessarily the implementation itself, are comparatively straightforward. Second, the strategic perspective permits the course much broader scope than would the alternative of concentrating in depth on a narrower set of institutions in order to cover all aspects of management. Broad perspective is also important for the course to make the maximum contribution to the career decisions of students considering jobs with financial service organizations, institutions that are not as closely examined in the corporate-finance focus of the first-year curriculum."

The course focuses more on the causes and warning signs of trouble, on what can be done to protect and restore a company's health, and on dealing with the aggrieved financial sources that are inevitably but unwillingly involved. The complexity of major turnarounds and workouts requires that the course material deal primarily with smaller companies and exclusively with U.S. companies."

Students will have the opportunity to reflect on their own values and ethics as well as examine and build upon their own definition of leadership.

Insights from these leaders and an array of readings on leadership will be used to foster reflection on what makes a great leader. The majority of leaders chosen for study, although familiar, are not business entrepreneurs or leaders of large corporations. The idea is to think more broadly about what makes great leadership by looking at a series of figures who offer a range of approaches to leadership and the value systems that can underlie it. Some leaders covered in past courses were Sir Ernest Shackleton, George Patton, Chairman Mao, Oscar Schindler, Mahatma Gandhi, Margaret Thatcher, Martin Luther King, Jr., Mustafa Ataturk, Al Groh, Cynthia Cooper, Ann Fudge, and Muhammad Yunus.
