12/5/2023 10:59:33,bxm8vr@virginia.edu,Mathmatics,2310,Matthew McMillan,"The professor may chat for twenty minutes a class. The grading guidelines are unclear and will vary each time. The grading is different for each person as well. That means even if you write the exact same process and answers with your classmates, it is still possible to get a slightly or dramatically lower score than the classmate. If you write something wrong, you may still get a higher score than the one who didn't make a mistake. If you copy the answer from the professor, you may still not getting a perfect score and get a comment saying ""need more explanation"". The grading is also inconsistent with what the professor talks about in class. In other words, the grade you get is partially based on luck. The homework is not entirely based on correctness, but highly based on the perfection of explanation, which is a highly debatable standard and the professor has the right to interpret. As a math class, the tests cannot reflect one's math skill. You are not allowed to bring formula sheets, and are required to memorize all the theorems. It is like a recitation rather than a math test. Explaining theorems is a big part of the test, and not math problems. Therefore, your score will not be based on whether you are good at math or not, or your problem solving skill. Your score will be based on whether the professor likes your answer or not.",1,1,1,3,5,6,1,10

You could go into this class without having ever taken a college level math course; don't let the 3000 level scare you. The class itself will come off very easy to anybody who has a strong formal math background; if you're taken Basic Real/Survey the class will be pretty simple. Her teaching stye is mostly lectures and collaborative worksheets. She's very active with Piazza, you can't email her but you can ask questions there. Her office hours are very early, but are very helpful; you can ask her many questions and she's very passionate about her work. If you haven't taken a 3000 math course before and don't want to take transition, this would be my recommended starting class; proofs are very light and there's little to no computation.

You learn the basics from the lecture class and from the worksheet you collaborate with classmates + him to learn other techniques; you learn the most from worksheet classes and while they're technically optional you should attend them. The most difficult part of the classes tend to be understanding the calculus (integrals and infinite sums.) Multivariable calc is not needed; the only concept you use are double integrals which he teaches well. Try talking to him both during class (especially during worksheet sessions) and office hours. Like most math classes, grade is about 75% exam, 25% other stuff. You get a cheat sheet for exams but that's purely so you don't have to memorize formulas; you need to understand the concepts to do well on exams.

Despite the interesting and useful content, the lectures were vague and hard to interpret. The professor's use of numerous examples and analogies made in-person lectures challenging to understand. Skipping lectures and watching them at my own pace proved more productive.

Assignments, while not terrible, required self-learning from slides and online resources. Homeworks offered an easy 100%, with extra credit for early submission. Labs, though not a great experience with dismissive teaching assistants, were a free 100% if completed promptly. Achieving perfect scores on assignments and labs is crucial, as quizzes, especially Part B, are challenging and demand knowledge of obscure details, resulting in average scores around 60%.",1,1,2,3,1,1,1,1

I went into organic chemistry thinking I was gonna have to take the L but he almost made this class enjoyable. He's very enthusiastic about teaching, all the time. So he's more than happy to answer stupid questions, repeatedly if necessary. I will say that we had concerns about learning different material from the other sections, but I believe Dr. Stains just switched up our order a bit. We got one dropped exam, guaranteed 100% on the homework since you got like 10 tries per question, and an extra grade boost from PollEverywhere. The discussion section is kind of a waste of time so I didn't stay the full two hours most weeks. Since I haven't taken the second semester yet, I can't speak on how well this class prepared me for that. However, I can say that Dr. Stains is THE GOAT. Wonderful man. Absolute delight to have.

Even though he's a grad student, he knows more than most of the stats professors and he's still very nice. A wizard. The class, however, was not fun. This course is all about getting used to Python and it really has very little stats in it. We did one week on using statistical modeling packages but it was more about the syntax in Python than the actual model itself. The entire grade is based on 13 homeworks (previous years had 14 with one drop.. we did not) that are graded automatically in Gradescope. For the first few assignments, your grade is just published with your submission, so you know how you did. But after a couple weeks, they started hiding our grades. So there was really know way to know what your grade was or what you should change. Our class had a really difficult time with this and they ended up publishing the grades again for the last two assignments. No in-person lecture, all the teaching is done via recorded lectures with an attached script. The lecture block is used for office hours. All in all, the class is definitely useful and I think it certainly helped my python skills. But it was really annoying. ",5,2,3,3,1,6,6,1

The work was consistent every week as you had the same 4-5 assignments to do,  Tophat readings were annoying and fairly difficult to get done but the other work was not bad. The lectures helped clarify a lot of the material for me, Stains was a pretty good lecturer and the slides contained all the important material and concepts. She is a very kind and sweet professor and will always help to give students the best understanding of the material. but means business at the end of the day. Exams are not too difficult if you keep up with the readings and homework problems and understand the problems in the lbla and bit.

I found her lectures to be very helpful and she was able to explain the concepts in a straightforward manner, much better than my high school calculus teacher was able to. Office hours are a big help and she is willing to walk you through any problem that you may be having difficulty with. The course is structured in order for you to succeed as long as you keep up with the material. The mastery based learning was helpful to keep reviewing each week and ensure a better understanding of the content without the stress of big midterms. Professor Ma listens to all students feedback and changed the grading scale of the weekly checkpoints to be more forgiving and allow more students to succeed. Overall this has been a great class and I highly recommend taking it with Professor Ma. #tCFF23",5,5,5,2,2,1,3,4
12/6/2023 14:34:42,hhf2um@virginia.edu,BIOL,2100,David Kittlesen,"As someone who didn't take AP Biology in high school, this class was pretty challenging and time-consuming for me. Kittlesen is really nice - he's approachable in and out of class and is receptive to answering questions/emails but he assumes that people have a strong background in biology. His lecture slideshows are basically just pictures/diagrams and in lecture, he explains the processes and related concepts in detail that it can be overwhelming if you don't have a strong foundation in biology. His exams are the ones that get people the most - some questions in the exams are basically paragraphs of text where it can be difficult to find out what concept he wants you to apply on the question. Other questions are also confusing + vague and can refer back to activities you did in lab. 
My tips for this class: the exam learning objectives he gives out are going to be your savior in the course, as he's going to ask questions related to them. Also make sure you understand the learning objectives to the T, since the questions he likes to put are application based (ex: what happens if x gene is removed from y). What I did is made an extensive study guide with learning objectives and used my notes to fill them out. I also made sure to find friends who knew the content better than I did and try to explain it to them. Make sure to also ask ""what if"" questions, since it really makes you apply the concepts you learn to hypothetical situations which is what Kittlesen likes to put on his exams. This course is pretty difficult and can be a pre-med weed-out course but if you can survive, you can survive the upper-level bio/harder pre-med classes. #tCFF23",4,3,3,5,8,8,5,7

He is obviously very smart, but more importantly he genuinely cares about his students-he will listen to feedback and tweak his teaching methods and class format to make it better for the students. His class structure is a kind of hybrid flipped classroom: he sends out a packet on the weekend with the week's materials and 8-10 exercises (to be presented in class by students for participation points) and 3-4 difficult HW problems, and you are expected to read the packet before class. In class, he talks about the concepts and solves a few examples. How much you like the structure heavily depends on the person; I personally really liked it. He tries to make the class so that it prepares students for higher level math classes; for example, a lot of the HW problems are proof-based questions, and if you get stuck, he will happily help you through it in OH. If you're an aspiring math major, I definitely recommend taking his class if you don't mind the course structure. ",5,5,5,4,2,4,2,1
12/6/2023 16:24:13,auj7tx@virginia.edu,MATH,1320,Yuan Zhang,"This Math Department course proved enjoyable and accommodating, especially as my first with the department at this school. Initially appearing challenging, it required a review of Calculus I content. Despite the difficulty stemming from a lapse in memory, adapting to the lecture style and instructor's accent made the course more manageable over time.

The instructor initially presented concepts with convoluted explanations, but this perception changed after adjusting to the teaching style. Our Learning Assistant, Sydney, played a crucial role during lectures, providing alternative interpretations and solutions when needed. The course became a breeze once these adjustments were made.

Regular completion of WebAssign homework, despite occasional confusion, contributed to a deeper understanding of the concepts. Jim Rolf's supplemental videos and other assignments, such as problem sets and quizzes, were manageable with preparation. Connecting with classmates for questions and study sessions proved advantageous.

Exams, including two midterms with ample resources, were navigable. Additionally, a final (which I haven't taken yet) awaits. Office hours, MCLC, practice exams, P2L sessions, and Learning Assistant-led review sessions enhanced preparation. 

I recommend taking the course with Yuan Zhang!
Despite initial challenges, achieving a desirable grade is possible with consistent effort and proper completion of assignments.

It is still a flipped classroom setup, which I honestly preferred because we practice the material in class. Almost every class is spent speaking with a partner with prompts she gives. The class goes by very fast, especially if you’re doing fifty minutes three times a week and people are participating. There are two exams throughout the semester that are very straightforward vocabulary and grammar. There are four unit projects that are either essays or recorded speeches that are mostly done in class that you can correct before turning in. There is no final, cumulative, written exam, but instead there’s a final oral exam and a final cultural project. She gives so much time to work on the cultural project and gives two opportunities where she reviews and corrects it so it’s an easy A. The professor is really great.

The class is essentially an introduction to statistics with a little bit of research analysis techniques sprinkled in. It’s almost exclusively z-tests, t-tests, confidence intervals, ANOVA, correlation analysis, and regression. There are three midterms, one of which can be replaced by clicker point percentage from questions during each class. So as long as you do the readings for every class and attend, you could get at least an 85% test grade replacement. The final exam is cumulative. He provides so many review questions for the math portions of the tests. The other parts of the test can be somewhat difficult as he will ask you to recall a sentence from a twenty minute video he assigned us to watch. There’s also a fair bit of vocabulary to memorize as well. As a warning, the lectures are extremely dry and repetitive. Very hard to sit 75 minutes for, but as long as you did the reading you don’t really have to pay attention. He also has a no laptops policy, but as long as you sit in a certain section of the room he allows them.

While attendance is not required, there are no assignments apart from essays, making lecture notes crucial for writing essays.

Teaching Assistants, like James Reed, facilitated helpful discussions, offering simplified interpretations of lectures. I recommend him. Attendance in discussions may impact your grade.

There are also nine short assignments (300 words) throughout the semester, but you only have to do four of them as he only takes the four highest grades of the nine. While these assignments seem easy at first, they’re graded on a four point scale so if you miss one you already have a C. I also found the grading on them to be quite strict. The professor and TA(Jacob Smith) were super chill; the class was pretty entertaining at times, especially the discussion section.

The workload was minimal. I don't remember many specific assignments, but there were some small readings and writings. We also had to watch a movie and write a couple of pages about it, but overall, the class was pretty laid-back.

He was incredibly patient in answering questions during lecture and office hours, and he always made sure to explain the content in many ways (visually, numerically, and in simpler language than the textbook would sometimes use). Although a difficult gen-ed to take, he makes the course much more interesting and accessible for all, especially with open-note exams. My biggest recommendation is to take notes on the textbook readings and use workshop time to understand the content at a deeper level than what may primarily be taught in lecture, as that is a significant piece of what the CHEM 1410 professors like to test students on.

I took this class expecting to fly through it based on past reviews. It was anything but easy, in fact it was my hardest class this semester. There were 5 quizzes, one of which gets dropped. They were impossible, I felt very prepared and comfortable with the readings heading in to them. My TA would just destroy me when grading them and knit pick. The formats were also horrible and we had almost no time to do the quizzes. The midterm was not bad on the other hand. There are two papers, the first of which was a critique of an essay written by chat gpt. It was graded harshly and did not reflect the effort I put into it. The second was better, it was creating a dialogue between two characters from readings around a given theme. It was graded much easier. I have not taken the final yet but I assume it will crush me. 

As far as the professor goes, JAM was great. She knows her information and is very passionate about it. Lectures were engaging and interesting to follow. I only wish more of the lecture translated to the quizzes, so that it could have been easier to review.

Before each class we would watch a 10-15 minute long video giving a brief overview of the day's topic, and then the lecture would be the instructor walking us through very advanced example problems. I wish we got more lectures that were actually intended to teach content, rather than just help us internalize the most difficult types of problems. Even though, at this point, I can solve most problems that could be thrown at you in a Calculus II course, I feel like I never learned the fundamental concepts that let me understand why or how I'm using these methods.

The homework consists of watching anywhere between 3-5 hours of movies/TV show episodes per week, and I ended up not liking most of the movies we watched, but I learned so much from analyzing and thinking about all of the movies we watched.

It got to the point where I didn't want to invest any of my time in any assignments that weren't directly story related, because half the time they ended up getting scrapped anyways. It was very frustrating that as soon as the class started to pick up the pace close to the end of the semester, we spent 6 whole in class hours just watching YouTube videos of authors talking about their stories, that were mostly unrelated to the craft techniques we were learning as part of the class. It was obvious that he didn't watch the videos beforehand to vet them, and it was a huge waste of time. I would recommend this course, but not with this instructor. If he's the only option, it's not the end of the world at all. He's a nice guy, but I was constantly stressed out by how disorganized he is. I have hope that he can change and hopefully get the class together, but I was saying that the second week of class and nothing ever changed. #tCFF23",2,4,4,1,2,1,1,1

The course was basically set up with 3 midterms (the third was on the last day of class) that were worth 25% each. The lecture quizzes were after every lecture and were 10% of your grade. Weekly homeworks were 10% of your grade. 5% came from career related activities (linkin profile, attending career event, resume...). After the first midterm she began to offer random assignment for extra credit that came from lecture that ended up being very helpful. She also was very accesible and was very good about office hours before exams where she would go through lots of students questions that I found to be extremely helpful. While the exams were not extremely difficult, there were certain things (cases, graphs, parameters) that you really needed to remember that sometimes were difficult to memorize before the exam. She did make the exams so that you could essentially get partial credit for setting up problems,etc. She also offered extra credit questions on exams that were helpful. However, my TA was not great and Kripalani would give us problems to do in discussion that would teach us some more concepts from lecture but my TA was not good at explaining any of them so I felt at a disadvantage because of my TA.

Personally, I took this class to see if business would be an interest of mine, so I was a bit disappointed by the lack of topic exploration, but again, that is very clearly stated in the syllabus and by the professor. Overall, I did not find COMM 1800 to be a difficult class, as the only recurring homework was small weekly textbook readings and open-note quizzes. We did have some more in-depth assignments, but Professor Hoopes is excellent at outlining expectations. Overall, if you follow the instructions diligently, this class will be an easy one for you.",4,3,4,2,1,1,1,1
12/7/2023 15:30:12,wgp3aq@virginia.edu,STAT,3130,Dan Spitzner,"To me, this course was not helpful in teaching me anything. It was a semester-long exercise in frustration and wasting time. I would seriously recommend that you avoid this class at all costs and only take it if you absolutely have to for whatever reason. 
1. Lecture does not provide any value. I attended every lecture that I possibly could and never walked away feeling like I had gained anything. More often than not, lectures consisted of seemingly random equations being written on the board, or the instructor talking in circles. He lectured as if he were speaking to professionals, rather than students. My most common issue was that his lectures assumed I had some highly developed foundation of knowledge that I actually did not have, and was counting on him to teach.
2. The structure of office hours made them almost completely inaccessible. They were structured so that each student may book a time slot. However the issue was that the slots were only 15 minutes each, which in my experience is rarely enough time to have my questions answered. Additionally, he offered very few appointments, and they would fill up far in advance. Often I would start a homework several days before the due date, have a question, check his office hours appointments, and see that there was no available appointment for another week or more. 
3. The homeworks were unhelpful as well. Rather than reinforce the material in a constructive way, the homeworks simply required us to copy and paste the code from his examples and change the numbers to match the question. There were numerous times throughout the semester where I found myself wondering what the point of the assignment was as I scanned back and forth from two different screens, making sure that my numbers matched the numbers in his example answers. They were not difficult to do well on, but they also did not require any understanding of the material. 
4. The structure of labs was very frustrating. If you have a bad group that does not take initiative, you are absolutely screwed. Labs are essentially glorified homework assignments, albeit they did focus a little bit more on the concepts. The issue was that the grading was so harsh that it was basically overkill. These assignments were very difficult to do well on, and dragged my grade down significantly. Exams and homeworks had this issue as well. Minor mistakes resulted in ridiculous loss of points.
5. The course structure as a whole was needlessly complicated and frustrating. The course has seven different grading categories, and each class is a different type of lecture, or a group activity, or something else that was unhelpful. Every assignment or activity that he gave us required him to give instructions for at least 10 minutes, or give several pages of written instructions, because they were so needlessly complicated that no one could understand what to do.

I was not frustrated with the course because it was difficult, I was frustrated because it felt like being graded on jumping through hoops rather than my understanding of the material. I feel bad that I spent a semester struggling in this course and I have come away from it being unable to describe pretty much any of the major concepts in my own words. It feels like a waste of time and money for the credit hours, and it will probably be my worst grade in four years of college on top of all that. I truly believe that this course needs a major overhaul and should not be taught again until someone in power steps in and makes that happen. To the credit of prof Spitzner, from all my interactions with him it seemed like he was a very kind person and was enthusiastic about the material. He was just unable to design and teach an effective course.",1,1,1,4,4,1,4,1

It's rare for professors to be both great teachers and kind people but he checks off both boxes. During office hours he effectively clarifies information and it's obvious he cares about his students. He is an engaging lecturer, but if you have not taken a stat course before I would recommend briefly previewing the lecture material before class. While homework is not required, it is beneficial for your learning. It's a good idea to start on labs before going to the lab section and then checking your answers with the other students. There is one take-home quiz per week and it's fairly straightforward, with a time limit of 20 minutes but usually take 5-10 minutes. He drops the lowest 3 quizzes and 6 labs, which is incredibly helpful. I would highly recommend taking STAT 2120 with Justin! ",5,5,5,3,2,1,1,4

12/8/2023 4:29:13,epe9ev@virginia.edu,CS,2130,Daniel Graham,"To be honest, I think this was both one of the most challenging and rewarding courses I have taken at UVA. There were genuinely times where the work in the class seemed excessive and made me want to blow my brains out, but after learning it, I feel that I have gained such a deeper level of understanding in the class, and am glad that I went through the struggle. To start, I can easily say that this is not an easy class. There is a lot of content in this class, and 1. if you fall behind you are screwed, and 2. if you don't get something, you better either learn it quick or you're screwed, and 3. prepare to spend a lot of time doing homework.

It's no joke when people say this course is hard, but I genuinely believe that professor Graham did an amazing job at teaching this course. For lectures, tbh I don't recommend them as the course is recorded, and it is so much easier to learn through the recordings, as you can back track and whatnot. Graham does a great job at teaching the content, but he does go by things quick, making it hard to pay attention in lecture. Take advantage of office hours and lab time, especially for homework assignments.

Genuinely, the worst part about this class has to be the homeworks. Most homeworks took a long time to do (probably like 30 mins if you know what you are doing, 2-3 hrs minimum if you need to learn ig), but all of them except for one feel like they have a purpose. The only one that felt like a waste of time was called escape room, and it's actually the dumbest assignment in the class that they should either shorten a lot or remove. Highly recommend you go to office hours to ask for help on it.

Overall, I genuinely think this course is one of the most rewarding classes you can take. By no means is it easy, and if you think it is anything like your other CS classes, you're in for a huge awakening, but after you finish it, hopefully you will gain a deeper gratitude for the subject.",5,2,5,4,3,6,1,4

Sometimes she speeds through the content, not allowing us to get down the information, and other times she would spend 20+ minutes on one slide.

12/8/2023 16:47:27,mmf8pz@virginia.edu,SOC,1010,James Hunter,"The course content and the way Professor Hunter laid it out was interesting however there were definitely some issues with organization and structure. Professor Hunter does not use slides and does not record his lectures so its crucial to be in lecture and take good notes or have a friend at every lecture to get notes from or else you will definitely miss things. I didn't find this to be an issue because I enjoyed listening to his lectures although sometimes they were hard to follow or he talked quietly so I would suggest sitting close to the front. My main issue with this class was the structure and organization. Exams were a combination of multiple choice and short/long response but were extremely hard to finish in the 50 minute class period. He ended up scrapping the first exam entirely because it was so long and was somehow ""unedited"" but he gave us the option to still have the grade count if we thought we did well (I wish he had given us our scores back before making us choose whether to count the grade or not because this forced us to take a gamble on how well we did, especially because exams make up so much of the course grade). However, the second exam did not feel any shorter and was just as difficult to finish in the allotted time. Further, he relied entirely on the TAs to grade exams and papers, meaning it took months for us to get grades back and we never got to see feedback on either. Also, the original syllabus did not mention papers but 3 weeks into the semester he decided to add them as well as 2 books to read that the papers were based off of. All of that being said, the exam questions weren't overly difficult and pretty closely followed what he talked about in class. I usually studied my notes and made a Quizlet in the 2-3 days leading up to the exams and did well on them. I did find the course content interesting and enjoyed Professor Hunter's unique way of teaching (his goal was to teach sociology like a story, rather than jumping from topic to topic). Hopefully some of the issues we had this semester get resolved and the class goes more smoothly moving forward.

She knows what she is talking about and teaches the class as if nobody came in with any prior knowledge which can make it slow at first but it picks up. A ton of the course material is super theoretical which I did not like as much. Realistically, you are going to be pulling betas from a Bloomberg terminal as going on with your valuation in the real world, but I can see how it is good to know the theory behind calculating those betas using projects and D/E. Anyways, the only flaw in this course was the way she writes the quizzes/exams. Many of the questions throughout the year either had typos or were not worded clearly enough to understand exactly what she was asking and she leaves the room during the assessments so it is hard to ask her for clarifications. One time this year she included a quiz question that was unsolvable and that made the entire class focus all their efforts on that one question, leaving not enough time to do the rest of the quiz. The midterm was very difficult, but I think other reviews are going to make it seem like it was impossible. The exam was curved and several people got over 90% raw scores on it, so it wasn't that bad.

I think what really helps is searching up quizlet questions of Iggy or ATI for each chapter of content. For the last two exams, they are open resource so I mainly used my notes and did not study too much for them and ended with As.

I do not know if it was because it was a Saturday or not, but most weekday clinical did not experience this treatment. It was very disappointing since I like women's health as a future career and this diminished the expectations.

You can fail an otherwise perfect essay (as described by the TA) for forgetting to write down the word count! On top of this the specifications, examples, and the TA contradicted each other making it difficult to make sure you are meeting the right requirements. It is not a difficult class, but it is difficult to do well if you have ADHD or are forgetful in anyway. 

I understand that it can be annoying to answer repetitive emails but the amount of times she complained about email ""abuse"" communicated that she just does not like to do her job. She was generally condescending about class rules, using studies with small sample sizes or lack a control group to prove that her way is correct. If you do not fill out the course evaluation you are capped at a C in the course regardless of your performance throughout the semester. 

She has a level of racial insensitivity that made some lectures uncomfortable. At one point she showed a white child surrounded by toys as an example of over-stimulation, and then a collage of babies of color to represent neglected children. I don't think this was purposeful on her part, but it did made me uncomfortable.

First, there was a lot of unhappiness with Exam 1. Daniel did say sorry and took out some questions, but even then, most students scored around or below 70%. This makes me think the exam didn't really match what we learned in class.

Then, with Exam 2, things got more complicated. Along with a similar very low average, some students' exams got lost, and they were given a choice: either do an oral exam with a set minimum score or get an extra 10-15% on their final grade. This doesn't seem fair or consistent to me.

The final exam had its own problems. Students who said they were sick could take it online, with no real checks, which makes me question if everyone was honest.

All these issues make me feel that Professor Graham isn't meeting the standards of a great teacher. His methods in managing exams and grading aren't consistent or fair, and this could hurt the quality of our education. It's clear we need a better and more professional way of handling our curriculum and assessments.

I took this course to gain a better understanding for statistics since I am a politics major. At first it was easy, very basic concepts, didn't pay attention in lecture or look at notes once until about 2-3 weeks before the midterm.

You only have to be there every other Friday for a lab. Homeworks were doable, and labs were fine if you had a good group. Overall, would've been an A if I put more effort, but I got into such a habit of not paying attention to this class because of the speed at the beginning that I had no time or motivation in me at the end when the rest of my classes picked up as well.

He talks in circles, speaks about a ton of concepts we don't need to know for the class so it's hard to differentiate what we actually need to know or not. Insane amount of reading which is boring and incomprehensible. Only 3 exams make up the entire grading of the class and you don't know how to take any of them. ",3,1,1,4,6,1,1,1

We had quizzes every Monday off of a huge chunk of reading, but I was never bothered by the amount of reading because of how INTERESTING all of the content was! Midterm and Final were optional.

His tests are fair, and very doable if you prepare by doing the optional homework posted on Canvas. There is a fair amount of reading (up to four chapters a week in the textbook), but it is absolutely essential to do the assigned reading. The clicker quizzes in lectures are based off of assigned reading for that class period, and Smyth will sometimes even include direct quotations from the reading that you have to complete to answer a clicker question. You also only get to drop one clicker quiz, so attendance is vital to doing well.

There are a couple of group projects that are pretty lowkey and I wouldn't say it's too much work except for the final paper. He asks you to write a 6,800 word 'manual' on how to be an entrepreneur despite not having taught you anything the entire semester. I know so much about him, but little about entrepreneurship. The manual then counts for 35% of your grade. The rest of your grade is a mix of participation and case votes, which he leaves to his TAs to grade. There are no rubrics, so you have no guidance on how to answer the votes. You don't get feedback for the votes until you've turned in more than half of them. On top of that, he plays favorites and doesn't remember anyone else's name. If you try to answer, he cuts you off halfway and rambles on about what you should have said. The reading materials are really dated, some from over 10 years ago which isn't a good look for entrepreneurship because it's definitely not the same as it was 10 years ago. The cases are boring and he spends the majority of the class talking instead of letting the class participate. Overall, he's a really boring professor who's just trying to relive his entrepreneur days through his students. You do get to work on your own project during the semester but as someone who doesn't want to be an entrepreneur, it was tedious. However, this was probably the only time he was helpful.

12/9/2023 16:41:21,tut4un@virginia.edu,ECON,3010,Jessica Kripalani,"I'm going to try to be as fair and balanced as possible in this review, keeping in mind that Kripalani is a first year professor at UVA. This means she realistically does not have the freedom to structure the course however she wants, and has to match her grade distribution with that of Santugini's class, which is designed to have a 3.0 average.

About my experience with her in this course:
1) At the beginning of the semester, I felt as if the lecture slides did not have math problems that accurately reflected the exam. She asked us for feedback on her teaching after the first exam, however, and this improved dramatically + she gave a more step-by-step approach to solving problems which I think helped our class a lot. She was very receptive to feedback which I appreciated.
2) She is overwhelmingly fair, more so than she needs to be. She insisted that we all submit regrade requests and that it will likely only help us (I don't remember if she said it definitely can't hurt us or not, so I'm throwing in the ""likely""). I got 8% back on exam 2 and 9% back on exam 3 through regrade requests, and it took my final grade from a C/C+ to a B (haven't received final grades yet, if there is a curve it might end up being a B+) I'd like to note that a lot of these were not from grading errors, and that she told us to argue for points and that if we have a compelling case she will consider it. 

Advice for this class:
1) You cannot skip class and expect to do well. If you have an ipad, I'd highly recommend downloading and annotating the slides, she posts unannotated slides on canvas and it's hard to follow along if you only have paper notes. 
2) Do ALL of the extra credit. My lecture quiz average was well over 100%, and it saved my ass in this class.
3) Go to your TA's office hours before every homework assignment. Homeworks take time and are hard, and the TA's are amazing. My advice is honestly to do homeworks on your own because it's hard to understand everything when you're in a group imo, but ymmv. 
4) Submit regrade requests. She made it very clear that she wants us to-- I didn't for the first exam because I felt like I would be annoying, but I wish I had, it probably cost me the difference between a B+ and a B. 
5) Talk to her after class if you have questions, she's super kind and will help. 

This class was hell, but I learned a ton.

12/10/2023 3:21:33,kfs7cr@virginia.edu,PHYS,2030,Maksim Bychkov,"Really awful. The lecture textbook explains the lab concepts better than the 2 hour lab. Be prepared to write the group lab report alone if you end up with a bad group. Grades are not rounded up and the cutoffs are posted around Thanksgiving (bell curve). 

The best advice is not to take this lab at all, but some tips:
- there are examples of high and low scoring lab reports from the lab before posted on Canvas. They are very helpful. I used them as templates and they helped me not get 60s.
- Pay attention during the error propagation lab because all the lab reports demand error propagation & it has to be done by hand
- the lab manuals have ""application"" questions in the conclusion section. Ask your TAs about them before you leave lab because the questions usually have a very specific answer/exact words that the grading TAs are looking for that you will miss otherwise
- you are grouped based on how you do on a math placement (ALEKS). It tests basic algebra. If you score 77 or higher you pass and it counts as 100% for that assignment. If you score <77/100 you will have to complete an online math lesson module and retake the test (5 attempts) BUT you will be grouped with people who passed
- Immediately ask your TAs to switch if you get a bad group or be prepared to do all the work alone. Do not delude yourself into thinking it will get better (it won't). Be prepared with strong evidence and/or hysteria because the professor takes it personally and doesn't like switching groups 
- The reports are graded out of 20 points. You can fight the grading TAs on Fridays to recover precious points. This is usually a losing battle. They do not like you
- The lab TAs are there to help so do not be afraid to ask them questions. The class is run by TAs. The only time I saw the professor was in office hours when he walked in and the girl I was sitting next to asked him for help with the pasco software and he started berating her instead of helping. He went on for 2ish minutes about how bad he thought it was–an exact sentence that he said, word for word, was ""this data is crap how did you even collect this??"" and ended it by telling her to redo the experiment
- Your lowest prelab score is dropped BUT there's a very long final/cumulative ""prelab"" due when the final lab report is due (which is around finals). If you don't do it, it counts as the dropped prelab.

Physics lab has been miserable for years and the department doesn't care. If you do take this class, don't stress yourself out too much; embrace the 8+ hours and tell yourself that you deserve so much more than a 1 credit physics workshop

12/10/2023 13:24:24,ngj9rx@virginia.edu,CS,1112,Nada Basit,"Basit is an amazing professor. She is excellent at explaining complex concepts in a simple, easy-to-understand manner. Not only that, but she is an extremely kind person who truly cares for each student's success. She encourages questions during class, and she always reminds us that she is open during office hours for questions and chats not just about the class, but also for mentoring and research. I would highly recommend that if you don't have any prior CS experience to take this course with Basit. Really, if you have the opportunity to take any course at all with her, you should do so. She is one of the best professors I have had here. 
Now about the course itself. It meets three times a week for an hour and fifteen minutes each, which seems like a lot, but each class is an integrated lecture and lab, so all in all it meets for the same time as the other intro CS classes. Each class, Basit would usually lecture for about an hour on a new topic, and then the last 10-15 minutes would be an in class activity/""lab"". These were graded on effort and completion, so you didn't necessarily need to finish them or get them right to get credit, which was nice because some classes I felt like we weren't given enough time for them. Each week, there was usually a programming assignment (PA) and a take-home quiz to do over the weekend. Overall, the PAs weren't too but some of them were a little challenging and time-consuming. You can go to TA office hours for help on these, but I never had very good experiences in office hours. Often I would wait 30-45 minutes for the TA to find me, and then they couldn't figure out my issue and they'd just tell me to post my question to Piazza. The take-home quizzes were also not bad, as they are open-note and open-IDE. Your two lowest quiz grades get dropped at the end of the semester, which is really nice. The class also had two midterms, which were difficult, but they're not worth that much of your grade compared to other classes. Basit also let us do exam corrections for up to ten points which was so nice. There is also no final exam, just a final project that is only worth 5% of your grade. If you stay on top of everything in this class, I would say it is pretty easy to get an A.

Background:
I am a 2nd year who took this class and took AP Biology my senior year of HS, so about 4/5 topics were somewhat familiar. Dave explains all of these concepts so much better than my HS teacher did. A lot of these reviews and grades are coming from 1st years who I don't think were really ready for a college level class, so don't be scared!

Course Overview:
-5 exams, all non cumulative (70%, often curved a tad)
-Lab (20%)
-HW (10%)
-Offers +1% for PollEverywhere, up to 1% (depending on how many responses) for course evaluations, and a extra point for things every now and then

How to get an A:
Homework
-Kinda hate Dave for this, but every attempt on MasteringBio you lose a point, so don't be afraid to double check your answers

Lab
-Lab was kinda pointless expect during genetics
-Check everything with your TA - they're so nice!

Studying
-Go to DAVES office hours - he makes the exams so he knows exactly what you need to know
-Focus on the learning objectives (and ask Dave to explain them to you if confused)
-I rewatched every single lecture, because you often miss things, and for this class, it's important you write down everything because there's a chance it could be on the exam
-Save your time, when looking at the textbook focus on the images and videos
-Ask yourself what if questions: ""What would happen if this stopped working?"", ""What's the point of this?"", because Dave likes to ask those questions on the exams
-Know every concept conceptually but also associate it with a certain image

NOTE: You will probably do bad on Exam 1 (I did), but take that as a learning point and realize where you went wrong studying/preparing/test taking. I did that and go >90s on every exam. Also, Dave is willing to help you succeed! He is there to help be your sherpa and talking things out.",5,4,4,4,3,1,3,3

He prepares you well by front loading the course with a Problem Statement (which I don't think all STS 4500s have) due early October and the Annotated Bibliography due around Halloween. I appreciate the format because I saw some of my other friends with different professors really struggle towards the end because they had coasted through the beginning.  I had a few gripes with the class though. He does require attendance (and he ends up being a little strict about it at the end in terms of your participation grade) and does not give you a lot of information when you miss class. He is also not an easy grader. He teaches two classes in the fall and one in the spring so you might get booted if too many people try to enroll and have to find a different professor.

I'm so glad I was able to get back into art and I'm so proud of the pieces I made. This is definitely the push I needed to get back into art again. Schoyer loves to see improvement and bases her grading system around that so don't go crazy trying to make everything perfect by the critique.

His first few lectures were interesting, but as the course went on, they became less focused and near-irrelevant to the reading and quizzes--he often went on tangents, and his sparse lecture slides made it hard to figure out what we needed to take notes on. The class had online quizzes every couple of weeks, and due dates and listings were extremely inconsistent, though Professor Williams recognized this and offered retakes if you ended up missing quizzes. Professor Williams also repeatedly cancelled lectures with no communication to anyone, not even TAs.

However, MDST 2000 itself is very interesting. The textbook, while long (and required reading for the quizzes), was quite fascinating, and the papers--one on ""A Day Without Unnecessary Screens"" and the other a textual analysis of any piece of media you wanted--were really fun to write.

Professor Barlow is excellent, just a very encouraging and friendly language teacher. She focused hard on fostering participation, which is necessary given that it was an intermediate language class.

That being said, I think this class is also just way harder in general. I took 4 classes this semester, and this class easily took up about 80% of all my time. There were days where I did homework from 2 PM to 5 AM the following day. 

Thankfully, this class is saved by the fact that homework and labs make up a majority of the class, and the professor allows you to use ChatGPT so it's maneagable. However, the exams were a completely different story. You could study all you want and professor Graham will just test you on the most outlandish nuances ever, and he might've mentioned it in only one class. 

I ended with an A in this class, but that's because my other 3 classes were very easy so I was able to focus very hard on this class. If you're taking this alongside other hard classes, it's going to be hard to manage your time. 

I think Graham is a good person overall and he just wants the best for his students, and when it comes to live coding, the lectures are very helpful. When he started doing live coding, I learned a lot. Unfortunately though, he tends to just do powerpoint lectures instead. He's a good person and a decent  profesor, but his lectures unfortunately don't help much with exams and homework sometimes, and I found myself doing a lot of independent research and studying just to understand what we were doing.

His first exam covered everything we learned from the first half and didn't deviate from it, his second exam was online and deviated a bit from his lectures but was still doable.

This class is pretty easy. Like some other STAT classes, Prof. Varanyak drops the lowest grade in almost every category so you can take the L quite a few times and still end up with an A. There's a ""lab"" for every unit, that's more like an extended version of the classroom and just tests your ability to actually replicate the stuff she goes over in class. The material is really useful, if a bit dry, and the lectures aren't the most engaging... but honestly Krista is doing her best with what she has. Linear regression just be like that. No exams, just a big project that's due in two chunks plus a presentation with your poster, oh and it's a group project btw. She grades very nicely, though the TAs do vary a bit in their niceness.

The class is .. maybe not the most enjoyable. Every week has either a quiz or a composition assignment due (both of which are graded pretty easily). The class only has two exams, a midterm and a final which are worth a good chunk of the grade. There isn't really any new content to the course, all of the Latin grammer was covered in 1010 + 1020. So this class is just translating. You translate the reading before class and then go over in class. for 50 minutes. 3 days a week. Very chill but a little monotonous. You're not supposed to actually bring your translation to class since it's supposed to improve your sightreading skills and working vocabulary. but... Nina didn't really yell at people for doing that. Anyway, the first half is just Nepos' Hannibal and the second half is passages from Ovid. So it's fine, not a very hard class but not the most invigorating one either. ",5,3,4,1,2,2,1,1

He's a great lecturer, though he tends to use very specific examples in class which can be hard to follow. To combat this, it's best to understand all of the lecture material BEFORE lecture as much as possible by reading the textbook, watching YouTube videos, etc. It's also important to attend lectures in person because he only makes audio recordings, so when you listen back to them its difficult to determine what exactly he's talking about on the slides. I wouldn't say the content is what makes this class difficult, rather, its the way Dave makes his exams. The wording of the questions tend to be very tricky and they are HEAVILY application based, so you can't get away with memorizing everything, you must have a conceptual understanding of it. I was never able to break an 85 on his exams even after attending office hours consistently and studying strategically. His exams are objectively difficult. I would highly recommend attending his office hours every week even if you don't have questions because he gives useful examples and demonstrations that weren't given in lecture. He also gives a good amount of extra credit throughout the course that can help you reach the next letter grade if you're close to it, but don't anticipate it to make some significant difference. Do not take this class if you don't have to--it is time consuming and frustrating. If it's a requirement for you, my best advice is to ask questions as much as possible in office hours. He kindly answers them and you can ask for clarification at any point. Try your best to absorb as much content as possible prior to lecture and do not fall behind! Although Dave's exams are hard, they are still doable if you put in the work. Dave is reasonable and always has his student's best interests in mind, don't be afraid to ask for help. #tCFF23",4,3,3,5,7,1,1,1

I had some very minimal experience with coding in the past in C and found the adjustment to Python was negligible. He was very willing to answer questions during class and to go more in depth on a topic if needed. The weekly programming assignments were not too bad after the initial learning curve that outputs had to exactly match the prompt in order to get credit. The quizzes felt redundant and not like an actual measure of knowledge on the topic and nitpicked minor intricacies of the language that in any actual coding environment a coder could just look up the documentation to understand an error. However they were doable with some studying. We were also able to retake our lowest quiz grade. Overall would recommend for everyone to take at some point in college. #tCFF23,5,4,5,2,1,2,2,1

Frantz uses PollEverywhere for the Clicker questions and Warm-ups/HW assignments are assigned through WileyPLUS. You have to do these assignments quite often, but if you have a study group that communicates often, you shouldn't miss any of them.

Your Discussion section TAs will answer every question you have and will check your work for you. As long as you engage them, it should be easy to get a good discussion grade overall.

The exams are the hardest part about Frantz's class. They are extremely difficult and require more application of advanced concepts than in anywhere else in the class. This makes it exceptionally difficult to ace them. Find an answer key for the textbook online, and run through all of the practice problems for each chapter that you're progressing through. If you do this, it will make your life much easier.

Thankfully, the lowest mid-term (of 3) is dropped, and you can get half points back through exam corrections after each mid-term. Even if you got a 50 on a midterm, you can still do exam corrections and end up with a 75.

She encourages questions and responds with thorough answers without making you feel dumb. She is light-hearted and tries her to make ODE bearable given everyone's circumstances. Choose Professor Marley if you are looking for a supportive and easy to talk to professor who will work with you to understand ODE.

APMA 2130 as a course is designed to be worksheet-based with little lecturing like a flipped classroom. No matter which professor you take ODE with, the content/workload will be about the same. The major difference with ODE is which professor you choose to take it with since that'll affect how effective the in-class worksheets and how well your questions will be answered. 
As someone who is normally afraid to ask questions, Professor Marley is extremely easy to ask questions to and always has a positive attitude towards answering questions. In the beginning, I went to her OH to get her to know her and all I can say is that she is such a nice individual who genuinely wants to see her students succeed. In the classroom she is equally a kind person. Each day we start with a light review about the unit we're on and reminders about what we've done. While it is repetitive, I found it helpful for content I wasn't completely sure about. I've heard other professors also do this light review but I think Prof. Marley's organization about it makes a difference. Before midterms she gave us an outline of content to know which I don't think other professors did. Prof. Marley makes the content very manageable despite the difficult topics. She is aware of harder topics and knows how to joke around and have fun in the classroom. Prof. Marley has such a passion to make sure her students thrive that it's inspirational.

He usually has 3 in-class quizzes (the lowest one is dropped god bless), and then a final at the end of the semester.  However, he'll tell you that a certain concept is important and will be on the quiz, and it's nowhere to be found. To get a good grade, you need to memorize EVERYTHING. I spent hours memorizing important/big concepts only for them to never be spoken of again, and the test asked questions about a tiny detail in the presentation. The final is even worse, it's cumulative, so it's on everything the semester taught, but you'll never know what will be on the test.

12/14/2023 13:37:47,ngj9rx@virginia.edu,APMA,1110,Stacie Pisano,"Pisano is a decent professor. She doesn't do much actual lecturing in person -- before each class, you have to watch a recorded video where she explains the concepts, then in class, you and your assigned group-mates do a worksheet together where you can ask her and the TAs for any help. I actually really liked this, because I learn math best by actually working through problems, but this may not be the case for everyone. I would say that the most challenging aspect of this course is the sheer volume of information you are expected to learn in one semester. The concepts themselves aren't too difficult, usually I'd grasp them pretty well within a couple of practice problems, but this is a class that meets four times a week and almost every class you are learning a new topic, so it is a lot to keep up with.

Some tips for success:
-Go to office hours: In my opinion, Pisano is one of those professors who is actually better in office hours. Many times in class, I'd get confused at something she was explaining, but I understood everything perfectly if she went over it with me in her office. 
-Go to P2l sessions: These are weekly review sessions held by students who have taken the course in the past. It's one hour per week of practicing problems with other students. The best part about it is that for every 5 sessions you attend, you get 0.5% added to your semester grade. I attended over 10 sessions and I got 1% added to my final grade. This was extremely beneficial because I was at a 92% and with P2L, I earned a 93% semester grade. So P2L literally made the difference between an A- and an A for me. Bottom line: attend these sessions, you never know if the extra credit will make a difference for your GPA, and even if it doesn't, you'll have gotten some good practice out of simply attending.
-Studying for tests: the tests are based primarily on the in-class worksheets. If you go through and redo every worksheet from the unit to study for each test, that will be plenty. The WebAssign problems are much harder, and she never puts questions like those on the tests. 
-Studying for the exam: The best piece of advice I have for this doesn't actually have to do with studying, but attending the in-class Q&A days before the exam. Definitely go to those because she will drop hints about what is going to be on the exam and what isn't. Also, be warned: the exam is significantly harder than any of the tests. Just study a lot, and pray for the best.

Every other day there was homework due from the Integrated Chinese workbook. It was recommended to handwrite them, but you could type them as well if you didn’t have time. For part of the semester we had daily quizzes that took maybe 5 minutes. We had a few tests that weren’t bad; we took them during class and they covered what we talked about in class. After every lesson we scheduled time to meet with a student from China for 30 minutes-1 hour. At first it was a bit annoying to schedule around the time difference, but it was super helpful to review and practice the lesson material with a native speaker!

We had 4 speeches that focused on different things each time—storytelling, 5-day challenge, persuasion, and one where you could talk about any lesson you’ve learned. I’d recommend going to office hours to practice your speech or go over any questions you have before a presentation. The class is small, so it can be hard to snag a spot unless you’re a fourth-year, but the upside to this is that it’s less intimidating to practice public speaking skills.

Every Friday we worked on a discussion post in class. We wrote one essay, and for our second essay, we had the option of revising our first one or writing a new one; this might change in future semesters though. The only thing that was graded was the portfolio (3,000-4,500 words) due at the end of the semester, which consists of one essay, 6 peer reviews, and a short self-reflection. Professor Little gives you feedback after each essay, and tells you what grade you would’ve gotten had it been for a grade, so you have many opportunities to revise your essays.

He will lecture as if you are a grad student, even though most of the class is just first years, but that’s because this class is meant to be taught like that. He's also very understanding and will give you extensions if needed (I got multiple extensions and he was very open to extending the extensions as well.)  

About the class: My class started with 39 people and dropped to 14 people by the drop deadline. Do the readings, do the homework, work with peers outside of class, attend ALL office hours. Having study groups and going to literally all office hours (prof and TA) are the only two reasons I was somewhat sane in this class. Somewhat. It’s definitely doable to pass the class without going to study groups or all the office hours, but I’m guessing you would have to be a genius (fun fact: I am not a genius).  

About the assignments/grading: We had weekly homeworks, given on Friday and due the next Thursday. Then we had a two-part midterm and a two-part final (both had a take-home and in-class portion). It’s not necessarily like 90-100 is an A, 80-90 is a B, etc etc. You’ll get atleast a B if you are putting in obvious effort and showing some sort of growth (which is also why I think going to office hours is super duper important). Prof won’t fail you (meaning you won’t get below a B ish) as long as you try and are somewhat getting it.  

About the time commitment: The work takes a lot of time. I was in drumline as well while taking this class, and with my time management skills, the amount of time I had as a result to devote to math was... not enough for someone with my minimal intelligence. (time committment of drumline btw: 2.5 hrs twice a week on non-game weeks, and then about 2.5 hours 4 days a week plus an entire saturday on game weeks.) It was definitely *doable*, but that was only because I got help from others (in study groups) and office hours. I actually cannot stress the importance of the study groups and office hours any more.  

Prepping for the class: If you do choose to take this class, you’re probably coming in with minimal/no knowledge of proofs. Maybe you haven’t even done calc 3 yet. I did calc 3 already but had no experience with proofs. I wish I had done some learning of proofs and linear algebra over the summer to make it easier for myself during this course. That’s just my opinion.  

Miscellaneous: Is this class worth it? Honestly, idk. I’m not sure if I should have taken this class, but no other math class fit my schedule and I was stuck. But yeah, I’m passing, and I will be taking 3315 so I can get the credit for everything. Did I learn a lot? Yeah, but that can easily be learned in the other required classes for the math major. Do I recommend this class? Not really, but if you are in love with math and want to be in academia in the future then yeah maybe take this class. I do intend on having math as one of my majors, however I don’t think you need this class for anything besides bragging rights. Did my mental health suffer? To some extent...  

I didn’t think I had this much to say so TLDR: Sherman is good, super tough class but grades will be fine if you just put in effort, you learn a ton, GO TO OFFICE HOURS, HAVE STUDY GROUPS, WORK WITH PEOPLE, idk if this class was worth it, prepare ahead, good luck. #tCFF23 ",4,2,3,5,2,9,4,3
12/14/2023 18:01:52,zne5rg@virginia.edu,HISA,1501,Neeti Nair,"If you’ve ever had a socratic seminar in high school, that’s exactly what this class was like, except wayyyy less formal and honestly, less stressful. Nair made sure everyone got a chance to speak, and welcomed everyone to speak their minds on what they thought. Each week, we had to write a one-page position paper based on the readings given that week, and then we would talk about the readings in class. Two and half hours is a long time to talk though, so she would give us breaks and sometimes end class early. She brought snacks to class sometimes (and brought special snacks for people with allergies), and allowed us to go off on tangents in our discussions. She’s super sweet and super kind. Definitely go to office hours and talk to her because she’s so so so nice. I love Nair, and I’m definitely going to be taking more classes in the South Asian department.  

Once november rolls around, you start working on the final project and presentation, and you don’t need to go to class. The project is a 10-12 page paper on a piece of literature or a film that was banned/was controversial, which SOUNDS bad, but once you start writing about the summary, reception, and controversies, you hit the limit pretty easily.  

Overall, I 10/10 recommend this class and I 10/10 recommend Nair. Amazing lady. This class wasn’t lecture-based, so I can’t speak on her lecture skills, but she’s brilliant for the seminar-style. I don’t think any other class actually had the capability of changing the way I thought about things. I unironically would think about this class outside of the academic setting.

12/14/2023 18:09:07,zne5rg@virginia.edu,ARTH,1505,Douglas Fordham,"All the other comments say this is an easy A, but if you don't like art, history, reading, or writing, then find another easy A gen-ed class because this isn't for you. I took this class because I read that it was an easy A, and I most definitely got below a 90. I struggled with the readings, fell behind very very easily, and found it difficult to do the writing on the midterm and final just because putting European art into European historical context was very difficult for me. If you have never taken an art history class before or aren't passionate at all about art/history/reading, then find another class.

Having said that, if you do take this class, Fordham is honestly amazing as a professor and as a person. Great lecturer. He makes things semi-interesting, but it's still super easy to get distracted in class. Pay attention to the lectures and take notes, even on the smallest things.

Really easy class, just like engagements should be. You read a chapter a week and write a discussion post on it, and at the end you do a group project on a topic your group selects. All of it is super low-stakes. The chapters are super easy to read, you can honestly read one page and write a paragraph for your discussion post. The group project is also super easy. Class can be kinda boring sometimes, but its always hands on. Sara is amazing though. She's super understanding if you can't turn in something on time, and she always just wants you to succeed.

Justin is definitely an interesting person (in a good way). He talks a lot though. But anyways. He assigned a ton of readings each week, but you can get by without doing those as long as you know about the topic a little bit. Every class is just talking about each ethical dilemma. Out of the two days a week we had class, we only had to attend one day, and the other day was a project day where we just sent a photo of whatever we were doing at the time. 

But Justin was cool, and the class was honestly fine. Genuinely not hard to get an A.

12/15/2023 1:54:31,yna2jd@virginia.edu,MDST,3704,Sean Duncan,"    Sean Duncan teaches the class, it seems, to listen to himself talk. While he opens the class for discussion, he clearly has an opinion in mind that he will not-so-subtlety push the class towards. Furthermore, he's critical in a non-constructive way, as he as an idea of what the message *should* be. Also, from an academic perspective, it feels like you are getting a colleague's opinion on a text rather than being in a class. If you want to read the readings — which, I will admit, are helpful to learning about Game Studies — save yourself the trouble and audit the class.

    When it came to the course structure, I found the rules strict, yet inconsistently followed. The strictness was in the name of education, which is admirable, but it was executed poorly. The class design is sound, yet the professor does not have the focus to maintain it. At many times it felt like we, the class, were against the professor and that he simply did not care about our opinions. This, along with an unfair enforcement of the strict rules, made Sean Duncan seem like an asshole.

TL;DR: 
    Finally, a warning. I was warned beforehand to not take a class taught by Sean Duncan, but I didn't listen. I would like to reiterate that warning. Sincerely, do not take a class from this professor. ",1,2,1,3,2,4,1,1

Topics honestly aren't that difficult, just make sure you have a network to collab on homeworks and labs which will really help, start everything early, take every extra credit chance (it probably will matter) and if you don't understand a topic, go get someone to explain it to you/it may make sense later.(Free tutoring) In my opinion, more difficult than DSA1 but not impossible or as hard as its reputation is, but then again keep the low averages in mind.

That means if you do bad on even one exam, you're pretty much screwed.

I'd recommend looking at the practice homework questions he posts, as they do pop up on the midterm exams. Also look at his slides, as they have key information that and you can't afford to forget even one detail on those, as his questions are super detailed on that specific information and help add to how hard his course is.

I didn't do awful, but getting in the A-range for this class is super difficult.

You could tell that he wanted everyone in the class to succeed and was approachable if you had any questions. The course has 4 midterms spread throughout the semester and a cumulative final which mostly focuses on the last unit. The midterms are hard but they are not unreasonable. After the first midterm, you can really get an idea of what they are looking for and this will help you study for future exams. There are also worksheets every class which you have almost 48 hours to complete. The worksheets are not too difficult and you can work with your classmates to complete them. I recommend making a group of other students who you can work through difficult problems with and check answers with in the end. You also have weekly webassigns, usually 2-3 sections. These webassigns do take a substantial amount of time but are usually harder than questions on tests so if you feel confident in answering the webassign questions its a good sign. The webassigns are also an easy 100% since you get 10 attempts per question. There is also a preclass assignment before most lectures which is just a short 5 minute video and 1 or 2 questions which are graded for completion. These are usually just there to introduce you to a topic before the actual lecture. The last grading section are the extended assignments. There are 2 throughout the semester which are basically longer problem sets. These must be done individually but you can get help from TAs or from the professor. I found these to be the most helpful when practicing for tests. Overall, this class is pretty difficult but it has to do more with the content and less with Professor Mahmood.

Each week will alternate between either having actual lab, which is a 3 hour block, or workshop, which is a 1 hour block. In lab, you run the actual experiment and write a summary as a group. The summary is usually just a few questions and then some data collection. The lab usually does not take up the whole 3 hours and they let you leave if your lab group finishes early. In workshop your lab group creates a plan of how the next experiment will be run, it is usually a list of materials, safety and disposal, and then procedure. On your own, there is a pre lab and a post lab for every experiment. The pre lab is usually 10 multiple choice which just give you an overview of the upcoming lab. The post lab is all short answer questions about data collection and calculations. Throughout the semester there will be 3 in lab quizzes which are all multiple choice questions and ask about the labs you've done so far. There are also 2 presentations and 2 scientific writings you will have to complete. While it seems like a lot, all the work is pretty reasonable and it is very easy to get help if you need it. Also, all assignments are graded on mastery, meaning that you do not need to get every question right to get credit for an assignment. Each assignment is worth 1 point, and if you hit a certain amount of points on the rubric you get that 1 point. They are very transparent on what they are looking for and it is easy to get mastery if you just do exactly what the rubric asks of you. You also get up to 6 retries if you do not get mastery the first time, but I have found that most people I know did not need to use up all 6 of their retries. I also suggest you get to know your grading TA, mine was my lab TA but I'm not sure if some people's is their workshop TA, so that you are comfortable asking them questions about why or why you did not get mastery on an assignment and you can get feedback on your work. #tCFF23",4,4,4,2,1,1,1,1

The coursework consisted of four 5-6 page papers, one 15 page research paper that you choose the topic for with some guidance and some in-class writings and outside readings. The class has a lot of writing, but it is definitely doable. Prof. Smith is super helpful at office hours and she does a really great job of encouraging participation.

It was very well-structured and I could easily understand how applicable this subject would be to the real world. The instructor was also really generous with his time and grading and was very receptive to student feedback. 

I would definitely recommend it to any stats majors / minors and anyone interested in data science, artificial intelligence, and / or machine learning. I would caution that you do want to have a decent foundation in R first (covered in some of the prerequisite options) because the course does assume you know the language decently well.

Most class sessions genuinely felt like a waste of time. It consists primarily of discussing companies' strategies and competitive environment, as well as how to diagram and improve their processes. There was a small communications portion as well. Most of the course was just spent rehashing a few frameworks that the majority of the class had already learned in years prior or could easily learn through a quick search online.

The instructors also could be quite vague in their expectations and were very inflexible to considering alternative suggestions to some of the open-ended ""improve X's systems or strategy"" assignments given. Other than Professor Gray, not much constructive feedback was given either. It felt like the class wanted a very rigid style of thinking where everyone had to agree with the professors' POVs, despite the course often talking about the need for firms to use adaptive thinking and be open to change.

Most of the homeworks (except 1 programming assignment) consist of problem sets similar to problem sets from DSA2 in terms of formatting. I'd say most of the homeworks are overall pretty simple enough if you keep up with the lecture, and the TAs grade leniently if you are able to convey your idea and know what you're talking about. In terms of quizzes, I'd say you'll do fine if you study for them. This semester, he made it so that if you score above a 90 (strictly above), then he rounds it to a 100.

I think there's definitely a rework on the overall curriculum as compared to a few years ago. This course now covers a variety of topics that acts like an introductory course to all of the other higher level cybersecurity related courses. 

Homeworks are overall fine if you understand the course content, except for a few homeworks such as Buffer Overflow. However, they do take a long time and you should start on it earlier. There are also TA and instructor office hours that you can access if you need help on the homework. As far as exams go, they are open-ended questions, and he wants you to answer each question under ~30 words, meaning that you have to know your materials and know what key points they are looking for. 

Other than that, I think this class is fine as compared to the other reviews. It's definitely harder than Orebaugh, but you also get to learn more about the technical side of cybersecurity. Bloomfield is also a very knowledgeable professor and knows what he's talking about.

Your grade is made up of four compositions, a midterm and final exam, a concert write-up, and discussion participation. They no longer assign any readings, and honestly, you don't even need to go to lectures if you just want the A with minimal effort. Exams are online and are generally freebies. Although, I would still advise you to go to discussions, since that is when they will do all of the teaching for how to compose music, which is basically all of your homework assignments. Lectures and materials seemed boring to me, but if you are really into the history of electronic music, then you should go to class. Otherwise, attendance for lecture isn't mandatory (attendance for discussion varies between TA's, since I had a TA that made attendance for discussion not mandatory, but I know another TA that does make it mandatory).

The other half of the time, the lectures are either in person or on Zoom. As far as homeworks go, if you have prior knowledge in programming (as in have at least taken SDE), then the homework assignments are relatively simple. If not, then honestly good luck since he doesn't teach anything useful and as for programming, you can expect to have to learn most of the things by yourself. Although, he is really nice and if you ask him for office hour, he will most likely set up a time with you and help you through the assignment. Other than that, the assignments gets graded really slowly, and there honestly isn't a lot of assignments throughout the course. The last two months are just project works with a group (you can choose your group) and that's about it.

Other than that, assignments are very easy and can be finished in less than or around 30 minutes. Professor seems to be very interested in the topic and really wants you to talk and express yourself (although he will cut you off to give other people a chance to talk if you go on for too long).

McBurney is a walking, talking embodiment of disorganization and eccentricity. His lectures feel more like a meandering stream of consciousness than a structured educational experience. The impact of his toxic attitude is palpable. He fosters an environment where arrogance is mistaken for intelligence.

Half the course content is somewhat useful, covering essentials like design patterns and testing, but the other half is a complete waste of time (JavaFX). It's clear McBurney hasn't stepped foot in the real world of tech; his teachings are detached from industry realities as anyone with industry experience would know. Half the time, I wondered if he was deliberately trying to misguide students without industry experience or if he was just profoundly clueless.

Comparing McBurney to Professor Nguyen, McBurney's grading is definitely less forgiving according to most people I know. But despite some of the grading, the class itself isn't particularly challenging. It's a pretty easy A with some pretty okay assignments making up the majority of your grade.

His attitude is another story. McBurney’s responses towards students' questions was a blend of snark and condescension. It's baffling how someone so full of themselves can offer so little substance. He's the embodiment of the sexist greasy CS stereotype who gets into arguments on Twitter or Reddit, oozing self-importance and indifference towards his students. McBurney seems to really show off the culture issue in Computer Science. According to my female friends, his conduct towards them seems to be much more negative. 

With all that being said, I didn't think the course was that bad, McBurney as a professor just put a really bad taste in my mouth. If you take the class, you will learn some useful stuff and probably get an A as well.

12/15/2023 18:27:58,nkt2pd@virginia.edu,PHYS,3650,Eugene Kolomeisky,"If you are taking this course for fun, first of all what is wrong with you, and second of all don't take this course with Kolomeisky. If you are a physics major or are serious about learning quantum physics, definitely take this course with Kolomeisky. It is by far the most difficult class I've taken so far at UVA. Homeworks take a very long time (typically 10+ hours / week), and lecture material is incredibly dense. Professor Kolomeisky's lectures are pretty much straight out of Landau, which itself is a very dense and complex textbook. I highly, highly, highly recommend having a copy of Griffiths on hand for this course and reading about anything you are confused on there. 

That being said, Kolomeisky really knows what he's doing and is an incredible lecturer and physicist. He takes some time to get used to, and can seem condescending when you ask a question, but he really does have your best interest at heart and will gladly make a time to meet with you outside of normal office hours. Give it a few weeks and you'll adjust as long as you commit to the class.

Also, there will most likely be a curve to be determined by Kolomeisky at the end of the semester. I believe there are many ways he can do it depending on the grade spread, but for our section he dropped the standard SIS grading scale by 12% so that an A+ was an 88% and a D- was a 48%.

Some keys to success in this course: 

1) Make sure you have a good group of people to do homework with. Homework makes up the largest portion of the grade, and it is imperative to do well on homeworks as exam averages are often in the 60s. 

2) Don't overthink exams. They are very fair, but also very easy to lose points on. The exams will NOT be on the most complicated stuff you go over in lecture, and they will NOT be close to the difficulty of a homework assignment. Make sure you know the basics of everything and make sure you understand all of the homework assignments that the exam covers.

3) Go to class. Kolomeisky will post his lecture notes, so it can be tempting to just skip class, but his notes are essentially a more difficult to decipher version of Landau. They should be used to go back and check anything you forgot from lecture, not to replace lecture. Go to class, ask questions, and you will be much better off.

Ultimately, this course is very hard and painful, but it's very rewarding on the other side and I highly recommend taking this course with Kolomeisky if you are serious about learning Quantum Physics.

The lectures are recorded but going to lectures is what helped me the most. Some topics are covered over 2-3 lectures and rely on you understanding what's going on from lecture 1. I took CSO1 the semester before this and it made reading C and assembly much more familiar than if I took a semester off.

The homeworks are tough and take lots of time but do have an autograder for most of them. The quizzes are not so straight forward either but had a comment section on each question where you could explain your reasoning and maybe get some partial credit based on the assumptions you made to answer the question. The labs were all doable but looking over them early definitely helps as many of the TAs during my section had different labs for their version of CSO2 and were a little confused when trying to help me.

In this course, you are largely relying on calculus (specifically derivations and partial derivatives) to complete the work. I think how she taught was helpful to me.

The class has three exams (25% each), quizzes for each lecture (10%), homework due every week (10%), and a professional career development component or PANE (5%). The PANE category is an easy 100%. As for the other, if you try, you can get a good grade. For the lecture quizzes, I went either to her or my TA to check over them and basically got perfect scores on each assignment.

I will say though many of the homework assignments are not something you can do on your own in my opinion. In each discussion session, the TA would always give us hints or flat-out solve most of the hw for us. She did say they were made to be hard and you won't necessarily find problems like it on the exams. I would say still go to office hours so you know what is going on. Before each exam, there are extra credit homework sheets that I think are important to do because it not only gives you more practice but you can gain back points you earned. 

The tests are not cumulative, and if you sit for all 3 tests, you do not have to take the final. To study for the exams, go over lecture quizzes, discussion problems, and examples done in class. This will most likely be the things you see on the exam. After the first exam, she started giving us extra credit problems where points could be added back to the lecture quiz category.

In all, I think this class was very informative and you could easily get an A if you put in the work. My advice is to GO TO LECTURE and PRACTICEE. She did not post the completed slides so if you don't know anyone, you probably won't get the slides unless you ask. Practicing problems honestly helped me because at times it could get confusing.

The class had 5 labs. Each lab had a pre-lab, quiz, and postlab attached to it. The grade totals like this: quizzes - 10%, prefab -10%, post labs -50%, lab notebook - 5%, participation- 10%, and final exam 15%. You can get easy points from the quiz, participation, and notebook sections. As long as you attend labs and do the procedure, you have participation points. If you come into the lab with you notebook done and write down all necessary data, you can get all those points. You will need these easy points because the other 3 categories are more difficult.
As I said, the grading in this class is down to a precision. They follow Chruma's grading exactly and this made me frustrated at times because I was not used to it. I recommend attending the office hours of your TA's or meeting with Chruma for prelabs and postlabs. I felt at times the questions being asked weren't taught in the lecture and made it hard to complete the tasks. 
In my opinion, the final was hard. Our year was the first time that the final was being done in person and what I expected was not what we got. We were told the final would look like the practice exam, but in my opinion, the actual exam asked more concise questions and wanted more concise answers. I still say to review the practice final given and go over conceptual questions on the post labs and quizzes.

12/15/2023 22:24:12,arg7wc@virginia.edu,PHY,2010,Maksim Bychkov,"My experience with this course was far from satisfactory, and I feel compelled to share my concerns and disappointment.  This course really is a metaphorical modern day brazen bull. Your screaming won't save you.

From the onset, the lack of effective teaching was painfully evident. The course content seemed disjointed, and the instructors struggled to convey complex concepts coherently. The teaching methods employed were not only uninspiring but also failed to foster any meaningful understanding of the subject matter. It was as if the instructors assumed students possessed a pre-existing knowledge that was never adequately addressed.

The benchmarks set throughout the course were not only ridiculous but also seemed to be disconnected from any realistic expectations. Instead of providing a solid foundation and building upon it, the course continually veered into the realm of absurdity, leaving students bewildered and frustrated.

The questions presented in assignments and assessments were nothing short of insane. They often went beyond the reasonable scope of what any student could reasonably be expected to comprehend. These questions not only failed to assess the mastery of the material but also left students grappling with a sense of inadequacy and discouragement.

The resources provided were woefully inadequate. Textbooks were outdated, online materials were often inaccessible or irrelevant, and the overall lack of quality resources severely hindered the learning process. It felt like attempting to learn physics without the necessary tools and support.

Navigating the Tophat website for my physics course proved to be an exasperating experience. The interface, far from user-friendly, frequently fell short in rendering equations and functions accurately, diminishing the effectiveness of the platform in teaching physics concepts. The website's cumbersome design and recurrent loading issues created an additional layer of frustration, transforming what should have been an accessible learning resource into a chore to navigate. The dense and convoluted content added to the challenge, making the learning process feel not just cumbersome but almost mind-numbing. The unreliability of equation rendering and the overall arduousness of interacting with Tophat ultimately detracted from the educational value it aimed to provide, leaving students grappling not just with the complexities of physics but also with the hurdles posed by the platform itself.

The exercises assigned throughout the course seemed more like exercises in futility rather than meaningful learning experiences. Instead of reinforcing key concepts and providing opportunities for practical application, the exercises appeared to be arbitrary and unrelated to the learning objectives.

The utilization of Expert TA in our physics course was, regrettably, far from an enlightening experience. The platform not only exhibited signs of being outdated but also proved to be an impractical means for tackling physics problems. As we attempted to apply the limited concepts learned in class for the first time through assignments, the inadequacies of the system became glaringly apparent. The challenges extended beyond its outdated interface, encompassing a lack of clarity in problem-solving strategies and a disconnect from the evolving pedagogical approaches in physics education. Additionally, the incorporation of group assignments, which were intended to foster collaborative learning, instead exacerbated the burden. The drudgery of navigating an antiquated system coupled with the pressure of grappling with novel concepts for the first time during assignments on Expert TA rendered the learning experience more taxing than enlightening.

the intent behind the course, ostensibly designed to be accessible to students from a variety of disciplines, unfortunately proved to be a stark misrepresentation. The chasm that emerged between individuals with heavy science backgrounds and those from humanities was not just palpable but actively widened by the course structure.

The absence of a grade curve, coupled with a grading system based solely on raw scores, further exacerbated the divide. This rigid approach failed to account for the varied exposure that students brought to the table. While those with science backgrounds may have found the course challenging but manageable, the same cannot be said for those from the humanities, who faced a steeper learning curve and often felt alienated.

The expectation that all students, regardless of their academic background, could seamlessly grasp complex physics concepts without tailored support was both unrealistic and exclusionary. The course, instead of fostering an inclusive learning environment, unintentionally perpetuated a sense of inadequacy among students from non-science disciplines.

It is disheartening to witness a course that had the potential to bridge the gap between diverse academic backgrounds inadvertently contributing to a widening schism. In fact, this course only further solidified the alienation that I felt and many other students felt and what was an apparent hierarchy : What's the point of trying if we are doomed to fail from the start? 

In conclusion, this course was a disappointing and frustrating experience : an exercise in futilitty. The combination of ineffective teaching, ludicrous benchmarks, and nonsensical questions made the learning journey more arduous than educational. I sincerely hope that future students are spared the same ordeal and that the course undergoes a thorough reevaluation to meet the reasonable expectations of those seeking a genuine education in physics and opens doors for growth.

PS: This course has left me with the unsettling impression that our program not only lacks consideration for the diverse backgrounds of students, including post-bac and non-traditional learners, but also fails to provide the necessary support and modern educational tools. The challenges posed by outdated platforms and poorly structured assignments highlight a disconnection from the experiences of students who may approach the subject matter from varied perspectives. As individuals navigating complex academic journeys, post-bac and non-traditional students, in particular, deserve a curriculum that not only embraces contemporary teaching methods but also takes into account the unique challenges they may face. I earnestly hope that the concerns raised here lead to a comprehensive reevaluation of the course structure, ensuring a more inclusive and considerate approach to education for all students.

For all intents and purposes, having Mahmood is good, or at least better than what the other reviewers say.

He isn't super engaging during lectures, so if you don't learn math well through self-practice, I would try for someone else. Though, don't worry if you get him - he explains problems well if you ask, and is very kind. 

For the class as a whole:
APMA 2120 content as itself isn't that bad, pretty straightforward for the first few units. Though, the last unit (chapter 16) is pretty hard. This will make up the majority of the content on the final, so be prepared. I spent most of my time studying for finals on that, and it helped (though don't not study the other units). There is no curve on anything, however the midterms and finals were reasonable (no ridiculously hard integration techniques or trig like in calc 2) and fair.

The experience can be a hit or miss depending on how you utilize the resources. Profesora Gorriz is sort of a strict grader when it comes to essays. The highest score she'd give you, even with all of your best effort, is 0.5 less from the full score. However, she's really nice and understanding when you have complications or need help. Office hours are really useful if you want to see improvement. She can give a lot of guidance on what to expect and do. 
As for the course load, a lot of it felt like busy work that took up a lot of time, but it was the only practice I did to learn the topics. There was a lot more writing than I expected. The quizzes are really quick and simple too. A little studying every day will help, but I never did that and still managed to pass them. The exams are also straightforward as well. he way the final project is assigned gives you a lot of time to work on it.

12/16/2023 8:09:04,hfh7sf@virginia.edu,CHEM,2811,Laura Serbulea,"A lot of work, but not difficult to get an A.

Grading distribution:
-Prelab quizzes
At the start of lab, you have 10 minutes to complete a quiz. They’re not bad, just study the slides and procedure, and you’ll be fine. In fact, because grading is so spread out, you can bomb these and easily still get an A. I believe you get a one drop as well.

-Lab Reports
I won’t lie, these take forever to write (4-6 hours). And on top of that, you have to go to a TA’s office hours to get the rubric, because Serbs is really picky about what she wants. But in the end, a lot of people had a 97-99% average for their lab reports. As long as you have the rubric, most lab reports you’ll get a 5/5 and TAs will take off points every now and then for whatever reason.

-Modules
These are a guaranteed 100%. Kinda silly and not helpful but for some labs there are online modules you have to complete before your lab.

-Clicker questions
If you pay attention in lecture, again, really easy straight forward questions - will probably be a 100% for you. Two of your lowest days are dropped as well.

-Lab citizenship 
Should also be a 100%.

-Final Exam
The final exam was quite easy. It is pretty much a long prelab quiz, with a spectroscopy, Jablonski, and flow chart question. 

Overall, I have learned so much in this lab. After learning the skills in CHEM 1821, we actually got to synthesize things. This course was way better than 1821 cause we knew what we were doing and most labs only took 2-3 hours. However, most of the times things will go wrong or you’ll get bad spectra and that’s unavoidable. The procedures can also be quiet bad as they’re know to give a bad yield. BUT, when you look back at all your hard work, you’ll truly be grateful you took this class and proud of yourself. Also, try to experiment which TAs office hours you go to. Some are super helpful and will help you answer lab report questions, others gatekeep.

12/16/2023 8:21:32,hfh7sf@virginia.edu,CHEM,2810,Laura Serbulea,"You will have a love and hate relationship with this class, but mainly love. 

The class is broken up by:
-Clickers
The class clicker questions are a guaranteed 100%, super easy and straightforward. However, the dicussion clicker questions got harder this semester and a lot of days I got a 50-75% on them. Discussions this semester were quite stressful as the content was harder.

-Homework, Pre-Lecture Quizzes, etc.
These were on mastering chem, and should a be a grade booster. You have one for every class and also a homework due every Sunday.

-Midterms
You get a drop for one of your midterms. Serbs also offer us +10% extra credit for our lowest midterm if we attended a game called Orgo! Pretty sweet deal. You also on every exam have the opportunity to get +6 points extra credit at the end. With that being said, you can totally bomb 1-2 midterms and still get an A.

-Final
Same deal, you have +6 points extra credit (if you get the questions right). Was truly comprehensive and only one page was dedicated to the last topic (amino acids). So it was pretty chill. 

Overall, this class is a lot harder than Orgo 1 because there is a lot of content. Thus, there is more textbook readings, etc. It is nice because Serbs exam format is always the same. And studying the textbook is highly recommended! It can be frustrating because you have to know everything in lecture AND the textbook — and it’s never clear what mechanisms you need to know and what not to know (since there’s so many). But my advice, would to be to focus on the mechanisms she actually goes over in class and not random mechanisms in the textbook that y’all didn’t even discuss. Serbs is such a great professor and she had high expectations for us. You can tell she truly cares about each and every one of us, and wants us all to succeed. She is a no b*llshit woman, and won’t waste time in class — she’ll take the entire time and lecture till the very last second (sometimes taking her lectures to discussion.)

The only assignments we had before each class was to submit two talking points that you could say in class during the discussion (based on the night's prior reading's).

Not to mention they're also recorded for students to look back on. The course material has challenging concepts, but as someone who only took honors chemistry in high school they weren't too hard to grasp with effort. One issue with the material was that the textbook would sometimes gloss over topics or not mention others that came up in the expos (they are more useful than you think). As long as you listen to lectures, take notes, and do the assigned questions each week, you can succeed in the class.

Meyer was a fantastic professor and is incredibly knowledgeable. She loves teaching and is very helpful in office hours with either conceptual questions or paper edits. 

The professor's standards for her students are high. Yet be wary that the responsibility of upholding said standards falls on the TA, who in my case was rather inexperienced.

Her teaching style transforms the class into an engaging and enjoyable learning experience, making complex financial concepts accessible and interesting.

Professor Kulkarni is committed to preparing students for the workforce. Unlike other courses that focus solely on technical skills, Professor Kulkarni emphasizes practical skills and the ability to articulate finance-related discussions. Each class begins with a refreshing approach — reading morning news and delving into various topics, fostering a real-world understanding of the financial landscape.

One aspect that particularly resonated with me was Professor Kulkarni's dedication to addressing important issues within the finance industry. She fearlessly broached the subjects of racism and sexism, fostering a crucial dialogue that is often overlooked. 

The grading for the course is well-balanced and reasonable (Class participation 10%, Smartbook Reading Assignments and Quizzes 25%, Group Problem Sets 20%, Midterm, Midterm Project 25%, Final 20%) 

Professor Kulkarni's Intermediate Investments course is a standout experience. I highly recommend this course to anyone looking for not only a solid understanding of intermediate investments but also a teacher who goes above and beyond to prepare students for success in the finance field.

I have never taken any stats class before, but I found each topic pretty easy to understand. Prof Ferrara goes very slowly but this helps you to understand the content. Because it's a flipped-class structure, the lectures can be pretty boring if you understand a topic. The labs are interesting and not too hard to do well on. The class and labs involve some basic coding in R Studio, but you're not required to memorize any code. As this class is ""for biologists"", all the questions are related to medical or scientific research/experiments. However, you don't need to know anything about medicine or biology to do well in the class. She provides tons of resources to do well on the exams, including practice exams that are pretty similar to the actual exam.

12/17/2023 13:05:41,kks9hk@virginia.edu,CS,2100,Briana Morrison,"The course is definitely not as much of a mess as the older reviews suggest. Honestly, my biggest gripe with the course would be the lectures — Prof. Morrison's slide decks are way too big (they appeared to be multiple slide decks merged together) and she moves way too fast during class (don't expect to handwrite notes and keep up). Still, going to the lectures was more beneficial than skipping (especially since she does coding demos as well), especially since the class as a whole moves very quickly throughout the material.

The grading breakdown is, in my opinion, very fair:
Syllabus Quiz: 1%
Programming HW (you get a few bonus points for turning it in 2 days early): 36%
Labs: 13%
Quiz A (an at-home, timed programming assignment with resources): 12.5%
Quiz B (in lab, multiple choice, no resources): 37.5%

The hardest of these are the quiz Bs: they definitely require you to study the material well, and some questions are just flat-out ridiculous. There is no final; instead, you can retake 4 quizzes (e.g. 2 quiz Bs and 2 quiz As).

No comment on office hours (I never went to them), but Piazza is a helpful resource I used a lot.

My biggest tips for the course are to finish the homework early to get all of those bonus points (although you can get a late extension if your program is partially working, only use these as a last resort) especially if the quiz that week is going to test on the homework's topic. Also, come into the class with at least a basic amount of Java knowledge. But overall, this course is definitely manageable if you dedicate the right amount of time to it.",3,4,4,3,1,1,2,5
12/17/2023 14:02:20,kks9hk@virginia.edu,APMA,2120,Christian Hellings,"Definitely try to take the course with Prof. Hellings if you can. He teaches the concepts really well, without going too fast for people to keep up. However, to encourage attendance and note-taking, he doesn't post the recordings — you need to email him to get the recordings, and sometimes he doesn't respond until a few days after. 

The instruction is partially in pre-class videos, which you watch and then complete a simple pre-class PDF worksheet. Then, in the lectures, Prof. Hellings teaches the rest of the material and gives you some time to complete the worksheets with other students and ask him questions. If you don't finish, you usually have until the next day to finish the worksheet.

The course doesn't require you to read the textbook, but you still have to buy the textbook + WebAssign (which is quite expensive; I think you can find access keys on eBay for cheaper but I didn't try that). There are two or three WebAssigns per week; although these aren't super difficult, don't leave them to the last minute.

The midterms are okay (if you study well for them, that is) and the final was pretty fair (not super hard).

Overall, it was a pretty good course under Prof. Hellings.

The topic of the workshop, history of Africa and Virginia, 1619-Now, was fascinating to explore. Professor La Fleur's lectures brought the topic to life, and the work we did in groups really helped hammer in what we learned. There was quite a bit of reading per week in this course, but assuming you're a history major taking this class it was not that bad. Every few weeks we would write a 7 page essay, with three of them in total. The grade was mostly based on how strong your thesis statement was and if you turned it in on time. Then in class when the essays were do we would workshop what we wrote with a partner and come up with editing notes for the other person. The final portfolio consisted of compiling the first three essays into one and then adding an introduction and conclusion. It was extremely low stress, and made writing a 25 page paper low stress. Would recommend this class to history majors to fulfill the workshop requirement and anyone that enjoys history that doesn't mind a little more reading and writing than the average class. #tCCF23",5,5,5,3,4,3,1,1

Honestly, this class can depend on which TAs and group partners you get, but nothing you can do about either of those, so...

Just make sure to never miss class for any unexcused reason, because the ""specifications grading"" used by this class (i.e. you need to pass X amount of assignments to get an A) can make it impossible for your grade to recover from one missed class. Make sure to get very familiar with which assignments you need to pass, or ""master"", to get the grade you want. Most importantly, read the weekly emails they send out ASAP; it clearly tells you everything you need to do for the week.

There were definitely chemistry concepts that could've been taught better, and the last experiment required us to use software that the TAs were clearly unfamiliar with. Overall, not a great class, but it certainly could've been a lot worse.

12/17/2023 17:39:08,kks9hk@virginia.edu,CHEM,1410,Kevin Welch,"This is definitely one of those courses you need to give the adequate time to in order to get a good grade. Prof. Welch's lectures are good, but they don't cover everything; the rest of the material is taught through a custom-written textbook on a site called Top Hat. This textbook is very expensive, especially considering parts of it are very poorly written, but you need to use it to get a good understanding of the course.

How this course works each week:
Before the day of the lecture, you have to read the Top Hat chapters and answer the questions in them. After the lecture, you answer some more questions to prepare for your discussion section (called Expo). In Expo, you work with your group to answer more questions, and after Expo you answer some more questions about the concepts. Your group will probably make or break your Expo experience—my group was helpful but rushed through the Expo material, which resulted in us forgetting to draw some diagram that we needed to submit later. TAs usually run your Expo section—if you ask them for help, they'll likely lead you to the answer very easily.

There were three midterm exams with three parts each (all open note/Internet, and for Welch, all online/at-home):
Part 1 is individual, and honestly not too hard.
Part 2 has five multiple choice questions, which are extremely hard. Make sure to read through the answer choices thoroughly, and take notes on why you eliminated certain answers. (this part is always 10% of your exam grade)
Part 3 is during Expo, where your group submits answers and explanations to the Part 2 questions.
The first exam's grade is majority Part 3, but as you get to exam 3 the grade distribution becomes majority Part 1.

The final exam (also open note/Internet) was a joke; as long as you have a decent understanding of the material, you'll probably get a decent grade. There is no final project anymore.

My advice: take notes on the Top Hat chapters, and try to understand all the questions in them. If it's very clear from the start that your Expo group isn't going to help at all, ask for a new group (luckily I wasn't in this situation). Each time the Expo material says ""draw this diagram to add to your Portfolio"", take a picture and immediately send it to your group chat. Each time you see a good diagram or chart in the chapters, screenshot it and put it in a ""cheat sheet"" doc which will help you a lot for exams. Make sure to attend the TA review sessions in person, or at the very least watch the recordings. Most of all, don't drop the course based on how intimidating the first chapter is—the next few are MUCH easier.

Overall, this course isn't fun and it doesn't make me want to take chem again, but you can get through it with the right amount of work.

For the project, there's a survey that's due in the middle of the semester, and then a presentation and 20-page double-space report due at the end of the semester.

The workload was a lot more than I expected. There are five exercises throughout the semester and each one took me at least eight hours to complete, with the final project taking around twenty-four. I imagine this time will be far less if you've worked with CAD or similar software. 

Professor Mark holds office hours around twice a week and is always available via email if you encounter any difficulties. He gives grandfather vibes and is super sweet. I learned a lot in this class and definitely provides a pleasant creative escape. The only qualms I have are that sometimes class runs a few minutes over, there isn't any clear grading criteria, and your grade is a complete mystery until it pops into SIS at the end of the semester. 

Don't procrastinate on the exercises if you take this class.

I took this course to simultaneously fulfill FWR+ and explore a new topic, and it was the best decision. The class is designed to be low-stakes in terms of grades, practically like a CR/NC system. It is one of the only classes at UVA that allows students to develop an interest in what the class teaches, and it was such a refreshing contrast to the high school English classes. There are 3 main writing assignments throughout the semester: 2 workshop stories (5-10 pages each about anything you want) and 1 rhetorical analysis-type essay. Majority of in class time is used to discuss the assigned readings, do writing exercises, or comment on each other's stories. Tanner is a passionate teacher; he encourages his students to freely share their thoughts and provides useful feedback on the writing assignments. Definitely would recommend taking this class with him. #tCFF23",5,5,5,1,1,2,1,1

12/17/2023 23:25:15,arg7wc@virginia.edu,BIO,2100,David Kittelesen,"I enrolled in Introduction to Biology with Dr. David Kittelsen with the expectation of gaining a solid foundation in biological concepts. Unfortunately, my experience with the course has left me with significant concerns about the overall structure and execution of the class.

One of the most striking aspects of the course was its seemingly insurmountable difficulty level. The content covered was challenging, and the pace at which it was delivered left little room for adequate comprehension. The workload was, in all honesty, insane, making it difficult to balance with other academic responsibilities.

Another aspect that contributed to the overall difficulty of the course was the lack of effective resources provided. The materials and resources made available were not helpful in grasping the complex concepts presented in class. This lack of supportive materials made it exceedingly difficult for students to supplement their understanding outside of lectures. The practice quizzes given a few days out almost had no relation to the exams which Segways into the next point.

The exams in this course were a particular source of frustration. Not only were they poorly written, but they also seemed to go beyond the scope of what was reasonably covered in the lectures and assigned readings. The questions often felt arbitrary and did not reflect a fair assessment of the students' grasp of the material. The difficulty level of the exams was unnecessarily high, creating a stressful environment that hindered true comprehension of the subject matter. Every single exam was a gotcha moment with nothing really being a fair assessment on knowledge or skill as every single question was designed not to test you, but rather to trick and deceive you to the point that it became anxiety inducing 

Furthermore, the grading scheme employed in the course appeared to be set up in a way that provided little to no room for improvement. This lack of flexibility in grading is concerning, as it may discourage students from actively seeking to understand and learn from their mistakes. A more constructive approach to grading would allow students to grow and develop a deeper understanding of the material.

Enrolling in this class proved to be an unequivocally miserable experience for everyone involved. Despite Dr. David Kittelesen being a personable individual, his approach to teaching did little to alleviate the hardships of the course. The lack of accessibility in the material, combined with the overwhelming difficulty, made the learning journey feel like an uphill battle. One particularly disheartening moment was when Dr. Kittelsen presented a bar graph, indicating that 90% of the class received an A. However, this seemingly encouraging statistic turned out to be misleading, as he implemented a vastly different curve with a significant bump to last years group and not ours. This discrepancy between the presented data and the actual grading system was not only perplexing but also added to the sense of disillusionment among students. As I reflect on my experience in this class, it feels like a series of insults to injury, leaving me with the impression that, as students, we were doomed from the start.

In conclusion, while the subject matter of Introduction to Biology is undoubtedly challenging, the course with Dr. David Kittelesen lacked the necessary support structures to make it a positive learning experience. The excessive difficulty, coupled with ineffective resources and poorly constructed exams, has left me with a feeling of frustration and disappointment. I hope that future iterations of this course will take into account the feedback from students and make the necessary adjustments to create a more conducive learning environment.

12/18/2023 9:41:52,ayf2ue@virginia.edu,CHEM,3410,Sergei Egorov,"Honestly, this is the worst class that I've taken here at UVA. Professor Egorov, while an intelligent guy who is very sweet, is not a good lecturer. He speaks mostly to the board and mumbles at best so trying to understand what he is writing on the board, and decipher what he is saying is near impossible. The grade is made up of three categories: problem sets, midterm and final. The problem sets are easy enough. Word for word, everything can be found in the textbooks. The midterm and final are more difficult but everything is open book and open notes so it is more manageable. I was never able to understand the content of the class, and even though the exams are open notes, that can only do so much good when nothing else makes sense in the class. I cannot say much about the other class, but if understand lecture is very important for you, then Harrison might be a better option for you. I only took this class because of my CHEM major but if I could, I would avoid it entirely.

12/18/2023 10:10:11,ayf2ue@virginia.edu,CHEM,4410,Charles Grisham,"Professor Grisham is a very nice man who is very approachable and knowledgeable. That being said, this class is not for the weak. Grade wise, your grade is made up of 3 exams, 6 pop quizzes and a final project called PSAFE. PSAFE seems like a big project (and it is), it I think it was very manageable and should be easy point. There are bigger assignments, but there are several opportunities for extra credit, and the biggest issue you might run into is the software being a bit buggy. 

For exams, it sucks because I found the content of the exam very interesting, but his exams sometimes don't feel like they test your knowledge. There will be big questions that he says to work on in class like ""be sure to do XYZ as it will be 20 points on your exam,"" but other times he will give example (cool examples) but there are so many examples that have so much nuance and it can be hard to remember and keep track of everything. Other times, he will explicitly tell you to study something because it will be on the exam and then it will not be on the exam at all. Grisham wrote the textbook, and all his lectures are derived from the textbook. I would personally recommend going to lecture first and figuring out what in the textbook you should know, and then going in after the fact to skim the textbook and relearn any concepts you might have missed in class. 

He will end up curving the class a lot. The averages for our exams were around the 50s and 60s. A general rule is 1) try to stay around the average or slightly above it or 2) try to show improvements with the exams. Grisham curves the class a lot, and if you can do either of these things you should be good to go. He does not want to fail you. He just wants you to learn about biochemistry. Good luck !!

Prof Skubby seems to care about his students and really wants them to succeed. He clearly states the goals of this course and grades the proposal not too bad.

It is a seminar class so she pays attention to who is paying attention and shares at least once or twice each class. She is a great professor and the classes are usually small so participation is key. Also, set a reminder to do your weekly discussion post. These are an easy A if you do them on time and meet the word count. They are worth 20-30% of your grade so it would be silly to not do them. I liked the structure of the class and felt like I learned a lot. I would definitely recommend. The hardest part of the class was the midterm and final because there's not exactly a rubric so she grades tough in my opinion on those (win some and lose some I guess).

The most frustrating part of the class are the readings. The professor is a very intelligent woman who values research and you can tell that by the way she lectures. However, that contributes to the dense readings that can be a lot for someone that took the class just because it seemed interesting (either way--that's not her fault). The class is not structured terribly at all. I will say the thing that makes or breaks your grade the most are the reaction papers. Make sure you talk with her if you have any questions. The final project is not terrible and can be done within two days, if you make an outline for yourself. I think this class can be a somewhat easy A if you show up to class/participate and also put forth the effort.

I think Frantz gets a bad rep, but she in my opinion prepares you more as the information actually sticks and will help with the MCAT. The grading and how she teaches the class are honestly set up for you to at leat pass the class. The grading in this class is split into points. So in total, all assignments are worth 1000 points. Clicker questions are 140 points, warmup quizzes are 65 points, homework is 145 points, discussion is 100 points, midterms are 300 points, and the final is 250 points. I will discuss each individually.

Warmup/Homework: These are mainly practice problems related to each reading. Before each lecture, there is a warmup that is based on completion. You have to get a certain amount right to get full credit. These are easy points so make sure you aren't waiting till the last minute to do them. Homework sets are 15 questions due every week except for the week with exams. This is based on correctness. You have three attempts for each question so use them wisely. I do recommend that you lean on others for some problems as I felt some were difficult. Also, even if you do miss some points, you can still get full credit in these categories.
Lecture: During the lectures, she has clicker questions. These are based on completion so as long as you answer you can get credit. She makes it so that you can miss at most two weeks' worth of clicker questions and still get full credit.
Discussion: This is an opportunity to practice so I recommend going even though your lowest two grades from discussion get dropped. It is also mandatory. You can ask TAs for help on the questions given. 
Exams: There are three exams, all worth around 150 points each. The lowest of the three gets dropped. One thing I like about her is that she allowed for test corrections which gave you back 50% of the points lost. This was a lifesaver as it allowed for me to get a higher grade in the course. With the test corrections, I had a B average for exams. To study for her exams, I recommend going over discussion questions, Friday practice questions, and questions from the textbook. I also recommend finding the answer key for the textbook as it is really helpful for assignments and studying. I will say exams are the category I lost the most points on. In my opinion, her tests are hard but not impossible. 
Final Exam: This is the hardest test you will encounter from her. I will be quite clear her final was mainly exam 2 and 3 content with a sprinkle of acid base. I'm not saying don't study stuff on exam 1, but you mainly want to focus on exams 2 and 3 things, specifically addition, substitution, and elimination reactions. 

In all, you are very capable of getting an A in the class. I had an A- in the class until the final which bumped me down to a B+. If you have a perfect score or a higher grade in all the categories and at least a high c average in the exams, you are very capable of getting a good grade.

Some basics: weekly discussions are required and are virtually 100% of your grade in the class; lecture attendance was occasionally recorded but never impacted my grade. Professor Kahrl was a good lecturer with a lot of passion for the subject. The course format was essentially that you would have a reading every week, which was usually 1/3 or 1/2 of a book. During the week you would be expected to write a 300-400 word reflection and then discuss the reading and reflection during discussion. Lecture existed to provide additional context and background for the topics that were discussed in the reading. There were 3 4-5 page essays throughout the class that all had easy prompts and were graded fairly easy. In addition to the weekly responses, there were also 2 (very) small projects and 2 easy glossary quizzes. In general, the grading and assignments for this course were fairly easy. It was rare that I would be able to get through an entire reading but even an easy skim or a basic understanding was enough for me to easily get through the class. My biggest complaint was simply that lecture felt as though it had no connection to the course itself or my grade. I would suggest getting on your TAs good-side by regularly showing up to discussion and putting some level of effort to participate as they will be doing virtually all the grading for the class.

That being said, this class has a lot of content. Goedde can go through dozens of paintings in a single lecture (I ended up with around 90 typed pages of notes from the semester), and while he doesn’t include every single image he shows on the assessments, he expects students to be able to discuss any of 150-250+ artworks (many of which look similar) for each exam. The timing of the lecture from 3:30-4:45 this semester combined with the slideshow structure of an art historical survey definitely made me doze off a few times, as while Goedde is well-versed in the subject, he isn’t the most engaging lecturer. The course is structured with a quiz (10%), a midterm (30%), and a final (60%) with emphasis placed on improvement, so if you have an A- from the first two assessments, it’s still possible to get an A in the class. Readings can be interesting but they’re definitely optional—all the information you need to succeed in the class can be gained in lecture (so don’t bother buying the books from the bookstore unless you actually want them). I found myself liking this class the most at the end of the semester when reviewing for finals, since watching lecture recordings back-to-back on my own time allowed me to actually put all of the content together and appreciate the class for what it was.

Pretty much all of this is graded on completion. If you have even a small interest in East Asian calligraphy and want an easy gen ed, I don't think you would mind taking this class. I would generally recommend taking it with a friend as class can get really boring if you're alone. ",3,2,5,1,1,1,1,1

If your goal is to be successful in this class, I would just put in the effort to learn the content as its being taught rather than trying to cram it right before exams or creating cheat sheets. I think if you were able to survive financial, managerial is not significantly harder. The content is quite a bit less straightforward, but by now you should be comfortable with the course format and general vibes. The class averages were generally high (low A/high B) and I was able to end with an A without too much difficulty.

His goal with the class is really just to get students to explore and appreciate poetry, and I got exactly what I wanted out of it. This is absolutely a discussion-based course, and once the class got more comfortable, it got a lot more interesting. Edmundson cares a lot about his students and about what he’s teaching, and he pushes those in his class to think critically without forcing them out of their comfort zone. Each class, you’re expected to read a few poems and write a couple sentences responding to a question (these assignments are sometimes, but not always, collected), and the assessments in the class are two poem identification quizzes and one 2000-word final paper on your favorite poet from the course. Overall, I’d absolutely recommend this class to anyone looking to dip their toes into poetry! Edmundson is great. #tCFF23",5,4,4,2,2,1,1,1

Prof Lockwood is really sweet and wholesome but his teaching style is not for everyone. Lectures kinda feel like they're not really going anywhere and its easy to get distracted. The content itself is foundationally based upon the fact that econ is not always the answer so it can get confusing. Most lectures were structured around poll everywhere questions, however he would never give us a genuine answer for any of the questions. It became really easy to zone off or distract myself in class. With that being said, the course content is genuinely interesting and not particularly difficult. There is 1 midterm, 1 (dutch knockout) final, and 5 problem sets with the lowest grade being dropped. The problem sets themselves honestly felt very difficult and not at all similar to what was taught in lecture. I would have to go to a TAs office hours every time to work on it with the group and I still wouldn't get stellar grades on them. The final was incredibly difficult, but the rest of the graded items in the class weren't horrible. If I was more consistent about paying attention in class and attending TA discussions, I think I could've performed much better, but for the effort I put into the class I felt like it was graded fairly and I'm generally satisfied.

Pretty much the only grades in this class were the 3 midterms and 1 final. The dutch knockout is really generous and saved me. McGee is an absolutely horrible lecturer. He is disorganized, confusing, boring, and constantly goes on tangents. Going to lecture only makes me even more confused and generally lost. The only way to be successful in this class is spend upwards of 12-14 hours the weekend before an exam sitting down and memorizing every question on the practice exams, practice questions and the end of slides, and handouts. He doesn't even ask us to apply that information. The exams will be word-for-word from those resources. While this sounds easy and for many it was, this really isn't how I learn and I found myself struggling a lot more then I should've in this course. I ended up doing worse than intermediate Micro simply because I could not get myself to memorize all that content in time. If you have the time, motivation, and tenacity to do that kind of brunt memorization, then McGee might be best for you. However, I personally wish I opted for Westerfield.

The course was pretty interesting and simple, but really boring. The concepts themselves could be really fun to learn, but they they it's taught it not the best. The professor only lectures, so he doesn't pay attention to what does on in class. He also only ever remembers 5 names, so he only calls on those students for discussions. There are small weekly written responses based on the readings assigned each session, so they're really easy to do if you did some of the readings. My only problem with the class is the amount of readings we had to do. The projects aren't terrible if you have a partner, but the readings take hours to do. It shouldn't be worth that much time for a 2 credit engagements class. On top of that, we needed to take at least 2 pages of notes from the readings, which he collects at the end of the class. The main reason why I somewhat liked the class was because I didn't have to put much effort during the discussions. ",2,2,2,3,5,1,1,1

Pretty much a low-effort class. The readings are small and simple. We didn't have to take notes on them, but they were used for the discussions and weekly essays (which are only 200 words, so really small). But I think it's possible to get away with doing only parts of the reading or even doing other work during class. The professor doesn't really force anyone to talk during class discussions. She is pretty soft-spoken though, but really understanding and nice. The guest speakers and hands-on activities were fun though when we got to walk wherever on grounds or mess with eggs and Legos. However, the course syllabus isn't determined at the beginning because the professor makes it as the quarter continues based on the students' opinions. The biggest thing to worry about is the final project, which can literally be anything. As long as you start it with plenty of time before, it's not a hassle since it's really open.

I didn't take other calculus courses here at UVA to gauge how hard this class is compared to the others, but I still struggled a lot. The professor is really nice and friendly. He won't be the reason why you hate the course. His personality (sometimes) makes up for the way he teaches. If you are the type of person who learns best from quick lectures, then this class is for you. I found myself learning more from doing the homework than from the lectures because it was hard for me to retain all the information so quickly. Maybe it would have been easier to review after each lecture. He is also really understanding when you email him. He often extends deadlines or releases information when asked by a lot of students with good reasoning. 
The work will make you hate the course. The amount of work is a lot though if you leave the WebAssign homework till the end of the week. But they are really useful for learning. There are quizzes based on the assignments and textbook, so it was useful to review those beforehand. The exams, however, get progressively harder through the year. But that's because the topics become more complicated.
My TA, Micheal O Cobhthaigh, during the discussions, was pretty intimidating to approach. He knows a lot, but it was hard to keep up when he explained. We also struggled to get his attention half the time whenever we needed help because a lot of other groups needed help as well. 
I felt like the course would have definitely been better if there had been more chances for the concepts to be explained. But that could have also been solved by going to more office hours. Also, don't leave studying for the final until the night before. This is not the course for that.",4,2,2,5,1,3,3,6

The professor takes the time to explain the concepts, and he is always willing to do more. He is really open and super friendly. He is one of the sweetest professors I met here. The workload isn't terrible either. They can be done in a day, and if you're having trouble, you can always email the professor for help. He also provides comments on anything you're doing wrong so you can improve (though I will mention that he is sometimes a little picky on how you write the programs, that's for the best of the learning.) The final is pretty simple to do compared to other courses, and the professor is willing to help with that as well. However, it was impossible to search up answers to the questions he assigned since he wrote the textbook we learned from. The textbook is very thorough though and could be used to review what you missed.

The exams this semester were harder in my experience, though; Median grades in Orgo 1 were around 90 while median grades in Orgo 2 were around 75. The final exam median grade was better at 85, but still lower than the final exam median grade in Orgo 1 which was 92. One thing I noticed that may be one reason is that often there will be material you are tested on that Prof will simply forget to let you know about/doesn't teach you in depth. You'll often find this out at TA review sessions (so it's very recommended you go, or talk to someone who did!) but these sessions are only a few days before the exam, so it may require you to do a lot of crammed self-study that you might not have time to do if it's during a busy week. So, my best advice is to prepare for the exams well in advance!! Start studying as soon as possible, two weeks prior ideally, anticipating the possibility that you may have to prepare more than you thought closer to the exam whether that is in self-learning material or just understanding problems from the discussions that were completely foreign to you. Where Prof falls short, the textbook will be your best help! Exams are similar to Orgo 1 where they are free response questions that require you to predict products/reagents/mechanisms and rank compounds based on properties. In that sense, you can learn everything from an outside source as long as you know how to complete the problem. In the end you will learn a lot however you learn it, haha.

The professor is pretty good at explaining the concepts, but I also know some people don't click with his teaching style. He is a really cool guy and definitely knows what he is talking about. He uses his own textbook for the class and he also recommends reading the chapters the same day as the lecture to better understand the information (but I never did that). He also recommends not to use devices to take notes and I would agree that it is probably better to use a real notebook. 

I think that this class does depend on having pretty good memorization skills (since a lot of the course relies on memorizing information from the lecture and the textbook). It is really important to READ AND TAKE NOTES ON THE TEXTBOOK! Also, there's a point in the course when he talks about effective studying/notetaking skills... I would recommend you do what he says because it actually does help.

The quizzes and the final test on the nitty gritty stuff about coding. I studied a lot for the final, but it did not go as I hoped. I think that it would benefit to go to office hours (I didn't so that was probably my bad), but if you want to email a professor it will probably not be answered for a while. Your best bet is to post on Piazza and I bet someone will answer pretty fast. 

Pettit is a really cool guy and a good professor, but the other professors also post their lectures so you can watch those if his lectures don't click with you. 

Make sure you try to complete the programming assignments as fast as possible because you get extra credit for turning them in. Also, if you have to fix it after it is graded make sure you fix it (check gradescope frequently). The programming assignments are a big part of the grade. So, I would recommend taking this course since it is a good introduction to coding, but keep in mind it's not an easy A. The course requires some effort mostly if you have no experience coding.

12/19/2023 19:18:19,ftn7cn@virginia.edu,CHEM,2410, Cliff Stains,"Orgo is hard. I'm not going to lie to you. It is a hard class and requires a lot of time and effort outside of class to understand the material and be successful for exams. Professor Stains is pretty awesome and I really liked his teaching. He was never annoyed about answering questions in class and while I did not go to his office hours, I heard that he was very helpful during them. He made a conscious effort to teach us and make sure we understood. He was also very encouraging throughout the semester and made sure to remind us that our grades would not define us. He's a lovely person and I am thankful to have had him. The TAs are also pretty knowledgeable and helpful in my opinion. The only thing I did not like about Stains' class was that his grading scale is 66% exams including 2 midterms and the final. There are 3 midterms total and your lowest gets dropped. He also gives extra credit. I did decently well on the two midterm scores that I counted and got a B on the final, which is really good for an orgo class in my opinion. But, because it was worth so much, I didn't do as well as I hoped in the class despite doing decently on the midterm scores that counted. I really hope he changes this for the future. Obviously, a B in the class is not bad; in fact, most people get B's. However, if his grading scale were different, getting an A would be entirely possible and also extremely likely. Besides that, if you read the textbook and dedicated time outside of class to studying, you will be fine. Orgo is a weed out class, but you will be okay if you are dedicated. You don't have to be smart, you just have to work hard.

Nasir Ji is absolutely the best professor I have had at this university. He is so sweet and really cares about the wellbeing and success of his students. He wants us to be engaged and is so helpful. He gives dad vibes and he is just such an amazing person and teacher in general. Learning a language is really hard, especially at UVA, but Nasir Ji made it so easy. This class meets 4 days a week and there is usually homework every day and quizzes almost every week. It isn't much work though and it isn't that hard because having a good professor really helps. I came in knowing nothing but there were people in the class that came into the class with a little Hindi knowledge already. Regardless of how much you know or don't know, you will end up learning a lot through this class. Overall, I highly recommend! Nasir Ji is awesome, the class structure is good and it is not super difficult to get an A in the class. If you are really interested in learning how to speak, read, and write Hindi, this is the class for you. TAKE THIS CLASS!!! you will love it and learn so much from it.

The homework was kind of boring at times, but lectures were pretty interesting. You could get by in the class without reading the textbook because Dr. Hornsby covered the same info in lectures. Before taking the class, I heard that it was an easy A class, but I don't think that is the case. You really do have to pay attention in lectures and understand the information. The quizzes and final were open-note, but if you had pages of notes and didn't understand any of it, you probably would not do well. There were prep questions to complete before every class and those were easy to do well on. The Prof and TA were sometimes picky with the prep questions grading and the grading with the final small group project and infographic. The class isn't super hard, but you still need to do the work and understand what you are learning. If you are wondering whether or not public health is a good fit for you, this would be a good class to take.

Before taking this class, I heard that it was an easy A, and I agree for the most part, but you still do have to work for it. The grade distribution is pretty nice so it isn't impossible to do well if you are a bad writer or have no interest in the class. I really enjoyed learning about the topics we discussed. Some weeks, we had a lot of reading and it was overwhelming with all the other work I had. But, Hagerman acknowledges that sometimes we cannot do every reading and that is okay. Skim before class if you can for background knowledge, and try to understand a part of it so that discussions make more sense. Hagerman can sometimes be intense and she talks really loudly and has strong opinions which are obvious to everyone in the class. I have no problem with them because I agree with her for the most part, but if you aren't like me, then you might not like her as much as I do. She is pretty nice to her students but can come off as intimidating. My TA was super awesome. Even though she replied slowly sometimes, she was still very helpful and easy to talk to. I highly recommend this course because it is very interesting and eye-opening and I think it is important to know about these topics.

She was always grouchy and made it clear on the first day that she did not like lecturing so we had to teach ourselves through her slides and groupwork. She seems like she hates her job and always has too much on her place. It just never seemed like she cared about her students and I was scared of her. The class itself was not hard, but she was a bad teacher. For me, math is simply one of those subjects I find hard teaching myself, but I had to because she refused to lecture. She literally told us the first class that she did not like lecturing so she would not be doing it.

The professor was unbelievably unreasonable compared to each semester in the past, resulting in an astonishing drop in grades for the Fall 2023 semester. She was extremely unknowledgeable about the subject, directly copying material from a notebook during lecture and unable to respond to questions during lecture. Additionally, in her office hours, she was frequently unable to explain concepts in the homework problem sets. Her graduate level TAs could not explain the homework problems even with the answer key. I have never been so disappointed by a Professor and a course. I encourage future BME students to do take this course in a semester where she does not teach it.

She cannot understand the material let alone explain it to a whole lecture of eager students. Allowing her to teach a class deprives students of actually learning the material. The academic environment is less than ideal. She expects perfection from every student despite her incapabilities and lack of knowledge regarding the material. Furthermore, she refuses to acknowledge her several mistakes and errors throughout the semester. She does not care about her students whatsoever, she only cares about getting her tenure. She told her students to rate her well in the course evaluations because she wanted her tenure. This is a major power dynamic, and students likely felt pressured or guilted to rate her well.

I will preface that fall 2023 was her first time teaching, but the course itself felt very disorganized for the first month. The TAs were helpful, but since none had her as their professor so there was not much advice they could give on exams. I knew numerous of my peers who dropped this class after the first exam since no one knew what to even study for. I also did not appreciate that lecture recording were often posted very near the exam dates, meaning if you missed a class due to illness/family emergencies, you could not catch up in time unless a friend gave you the notes. 

My advice to you: switch sections if you can. If you can't, try going to OH consistently and have a group of friends to work on the HWs with. Keep asking pushy questions in class about the test or you're not goign to find out what's on it. Good luck. ",2,2,1,4,1,1,1,8

He had a structure of Monday-Lecture/Wednesday-GroupWork that made the lectures too fast on Monday to be helpful for the problem sets on Wednesday. The problem sets were typically difficult but most people got 100's for effort. The quizzes were heinous at times but the lowest two were dropped. Exams weren't too bad. Petrov knows this subject well but fits the classic ""genius who can't teach well"" trope. Still a safe bet for an A-/A if you need to take this course.

The subject of the course is so broad but by the end, I felt that we had not covered enough. His lectures are boring at times (especially when going through models), but the content for me was interesting enough to stay somewhat attentive. The problem sets (about 6) are fairly easy and so are the exams. Discussion sections were optional which were nice — the ones I did go to were just problem-solving exercises. Overall, I think there are more stimulating electives out there, but you need a 4000-level one where an A is very feasible, I'd take this.

The first half of the semester was a lot of accounting stuff that I neither loved nor hated. I think the course content is important for international affairs but it felt too abstract at times. My favorite part of the course was talking about 2008, Euro Crisis, and Developing countries. The problem sets are very doable and Wincoop is helpful during OH. The exams are the same way.

The most time consuming part of this class were the lab and homework assignments. If you have to take this class, I recommend you start these assignments early and make friends who you can ask questions of. The course structure was the most complex of any other class I've taken, so paying attention to the course calendar is really important. At the beginning of the semester, I was pretty overwhelmed and that was reflected in my grades. I turned it around when I actually paid attention in class (surprise, surprise) which was easier said than done because he just lectures during most classes. Be sure to take notes, especially during his numerical examples, because it helps you understand what he wants you to know for the exams. I appreciated that each exam was only 10% of my grade, too.

Professor Rivero is an extremely kind person and an amazing lecturer and the class isn’t that challenging. Your grade consists of just 2 papers, a final, and discussion. He doesn’t make discussion a burden, and he’s always willing to help answer questions about papers and makes himself more available during office hours for those wanting to ask questions about the final. The final itself is not that tricky at all, if you come to lecture, pay attention, and take good notes, you’ll do great! The readings are also not that  bad, you read abridged versions of Supreme Court cases, and during lecture, the main points are summarized and Prof Rivero talks about the context for the cases (like why did they come out the way they did) and the impact of them.

First, yes, this is a difficult class. Yes, there is a lot of homework. Yes, Professor Groves has high expectations, but none of it is unreasonable. Every week, you have about 6-7 hours of readings, podcasts, and videos where you essentially learn the content and you have to take a quiz but the thing is, he gives you guiding questions so as long as you know the answer to those questions, you’ll do great on the quizzes. Honestly if you just go off of the questions the homework load is cut down to like 4 hours a week.

Additionally, there are a few assignments throughout the semester. First is the Personal Energy Audit, lots of calculations, but not that difficult. The Civic Engagement assignment, where you basically petition and advocate for a certain sustainable initiative in the community (it changes every semester), and the final paper, which is long but it’s open topic. Put in the effort, and you’ll do well on them, he’s not a tough grade if he sees the effort.

Further, I know the final has a bad rep, it’s definitely not easy, and the average is typically a C+ or B- but all I can say is USE THE STUDY GUIDE RELIGIOUSLY!! It’s 18 pages of question after question but take the time to go through every single one and actually write out answers to every single one, I did that and ended up getting an A, so it’s absolutely doable. 

Finally, Groves is a very kind person, go talk to him during office hours. He’s really committed to involving his students in making the world a better place, he can be a little aloof at first, but at his core, I’ve found he cares more about teaching and us learning than following guidelines and focusing on grades and scoring. 

Btw the fact that he can run a 75 person class without TAs is amazing too, I mean I think he sees the value of individualized instruction and more time with a real professor rather than some questionable TA, so kudos to him for that, too.

He’s such a kind, understanding, and sympathetic person and an equally great lecturer/instructor. There is some reading (but you have the class three times a week, so you get about 20 ish pages per class) and some of them are kinda dense. But he’s really really good at breaking it down. I will say, even though it’s an American Politics class, there is a lot of theory in it. You start by reading Aristotle, Locke, Smith and Marx. Then you read Jefferson, Hamilton, Tocqueville, ie when you start looking more at the US, you read stuff from the gilded age, and then FDR, then Rawls (that’s a tough one) and you finish with modern interpretations and views about inequality. 

But ultimately, it’s very insightful and really makes you think about the way we live and we transact with others and relates it to the institutions that we are under. Honestly, you should absolutely do the readings, but you should be fine if you don’t. But Pivonka knows who is and isn’t doing the readings, and he loves everyone but if you really want to get close to one of the best professors at UVA, do the readings and just give a comment during lectures (or seminars whatever they’re called because this is a seminar style class haha) it doesn’t need to be insightful just be engaged, you’ll get a lot out of it :))",5,5,5,2,3,1,1,1

Professor Pivonka is an extremely kind and understanding professor, too. He gives no questions asked extensions, and really just wants you to learn first.
