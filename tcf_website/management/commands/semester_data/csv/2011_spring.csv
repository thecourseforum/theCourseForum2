A variety of illustrative boundary value problems will be discussed which exhibit some of the foregoing features. Both physical and mathematical implications considered. The results are applicable to rubber-like and biological materials and the theory serves as a prototype for more elaborate nonlinear theories of mechanics of continuous media.

Therefore this course provides a general understanding of the basic tax consequences of fundamental restructuring strategies and a framework for evaluating the priority that taxes have in these strategies. The course requires students to analyze how tax consequences affect the value of different strategies to the buyer and seller. Understanding the effect of taxes on the value of a deal to the buyer and seller prepares future financial executives and strategic advisors to make better decisions and to be more effective negotiators. Although the course focuses on the tax consequences of restructuring strategies and their valuation implications, it also covers the nontax advantages and disadvantages of these strategies.

Other topics will be entity formation, taxable asset and stock acquisitions, tax-free asset and stock reorganizations, and divestitures and liquidations.

In the course, students will discover that the issues, challenges, and perspectives differ as much as the numbers in the financials as well as what happens after the start-up or acquisition of a firm. Typical issues addressed are finding a job with a smaller enterprise, the characteristics of the smaller enterprise, creating value as a smaller enterprise CEO, management transitions associated with stages of small business growth, challenges of finding, retaining, and losing employees, special issues and considerations in the family-owned business, franchising as a financing and growth mechanism, import-export operations and international dimensions of small business, ethical challenges of everyday life in the small firm, the balancing act of personal, family, and business realities of the smaller firm, and exiting a venture on your terms."

It focuses on how leaders can construct environments that encourage employees to search for innovative ways to improve the competitiveness of the enterprise, on a daily basis without external direction and instruction, and how these environments (cultures) can guide both strategic and executive decisions to optimize enterprise performance. It also demonstrates why innovation is increasingly important, not only to technology companies but also to companies across a broad spectrum of industries. Through business cases and filmed interviews, students will examine companies and leaders that have been successful at building cultures of innovation. The course is intended for students who seek to lead a business organization. It may also be useful for students wishing to pursue an investment career, as identifying leadership that creates cultures of innovation is believed by many to be a key ingredient in successful investing.

While the course is aimed at those interested in business-to-business marketing, it is also appropriate for those seeking careers in consulting, manufacturing, and nonmarketing functional areas of business-to-business firms. The course emphasizes the tactical aspects of business marketing as well as conceptual and strategic elements of the marketing-planning process. The course begins by examining how to organize the marketing function and then moves to the topics of buyer-seller relationships, sales force management, complexities and problems inherent in forging longer term partnerships, and developing and managing complex distribution systems along with some exposure to product development and launch. Cases have been chosen from a variety of settings, ranging from high tech to 'metal bending' and from the emerging to the more mature businesses. As opportunities arise, the course will incorporate a 'live' case. Working with a company to address critical marketing problems, student teams will be assigned to work on these problems. These projects comprise the final project for the course and take the class work from the written-case analysis to the real-time case analysis. Topics for study are chosen based on the importance to the firm and on the relevance of the topic to the content of the course."

The name of the course accurately describes its contents: strategic management of organizations that create and deliver financial products. There are several reasons for studying the strategic management challenges of financial service organizations. First, this aspect of financial service organizations management has been the make-or-break decision for financial service organizations in recent years. Some segments of the financial service industry end up with capital needs, and others find themselves with surplus but expensive capital. Either problem can be fatal. Once the strategy has been selected, however, the implementation decisions, although not necessarily the implementation itself, are comparatively straightforward. Second, the strategic perspective permits the course much broader scope than would the alternative of concentrating in depth on a narrower set of institutions in order to cover all aspects of management. Broad perspective is also important for the course to make the maximum contribution to the career decisions of students considering jobs with financial service organizations, institutions that are not as closely examined in the corporate-finance focus of the first-year curriculum."

Two mock pit-trading sessions will give students firsthand experience in simulated pit-trading environments and illustrate necessary trading skills.

Values and ethics as essential elements of leadership are the central focus. The course will provide students with examples and models of ways in which leaders have incorporated ethics and values into many definitions of leadership. Students will have the opportunity to reflect on their own values and ethics as well as examine and build upon their own definition of leadership. Each session will be devoted to a different leader, focusing on their background, context, and type of leadership they displayed. Insights from these leaders and an array of readings on leadership will be used to foster reflection on what makes a great leader. The majority of leaders chosen for study, although familiar, are not business entrepreneurs or leaders of large corporations. The idea is to think more broadly about what makes great leadership by looking at a series of figures who offer a range of approaches to leadership and the value systems that can underlie it. Some leaders covered in past courses were Sir Ernest Shackleton, George Patton, Chairman Mao, Oscar Schindler, Mahatma Gandhi, Margaret Thatcher, Martin Luther King, Jr., Mustafa Ataturk, Al Groh, Cynthia Cooper, Ann Fudge, and Muhammad Yunus. Our focus will be on these leaders, their stories, and how they connect values and leadership, but at the end of each study students will connect the discussions back to the present and their challenges as future leaders."

Throughout, three questions pertain: 1) Where are the opportunities for leadership? 2) How do leaders think? and 3) What do the best leaders do? This course serves as a stand-alone course and also as a prerequisite to advanced leadership courses. Students interested in taking the leadership curriculum-another three-hour course in the third year, followed by a six-hour, field-based independent study in a leadership role, will submit an application later in the semester. The course is cross-listed as COMM 2600. The course is not a prerequisite for the Commerce School, and does not fulfill any Commerce School requirements.
