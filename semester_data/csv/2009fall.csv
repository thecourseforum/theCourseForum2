It draws heavily upon analytical techniques provided in the First Year Financial Management and Policies course and deepens and extends the core theory introduced in that course by examining its application to many of the key policy challenges that confront public corporations. The course consists of four modules. Short-Term Financing and Working Capital Management and Capital Structure Policy are two that look at a series of policy issues that confront CFOs in the course of their day-to-day operations. Topics addressed in these two modules range from forecasting short-term financial needs to assessing the impact of alternative capital structures upon the implementation of corporate strategy. The final two modules, Mergers and Acquisitions and Restructuring and Bankruptcy, examine the role of financial analysis in effecting value-enhancing corporate transitions. Topics addressed range from the identification and quantification of merger synergies to the key strategic and procedural aspects of U.S. bankruptcy filings. Occasionally, the course also harnesses some of the more advanced techniques presented in the First Year Valuation in Financial Markets course. Each case, however, adopts a strictly managerial perspective, utilizing advanced techniques only as they prove necessary to solve specific managerial problems.

The valuation tools considered begin with basic arbitrage relationships and from there students will develop the Black-Scholes model. The course will also introduce the binomial approach and will use it as the primary valuation framework throughout the course. Students will also, through the use of assignments and problem sets, develop an intuitive understanding of why these products are used and the fundamental relationships that underlay all derivative products."

During the course, students will utilize business simulations to design new managerial policies aimed at improving performance and testing alternative business scenarios. The course is highly participatory, relying on workshops, simulations, and interaction with classmates and guest speakers to complement readings, cases, and exercises. Throughout the course, special emphasis is placed on the ability to communicate with others to build a shared understanding of business processes, decisions, and business performance insights.

In this industry, whether Biotech or Devices, the consumer of products, the patient, does not choose the product, pay for it, or have any say about what products are available. This is a unique environment in which anyone involved needs to have a working knowledge of the philosophy, terminology, and processes their clients, companies, or products will have to follow. The course is not designed to make students regulatory experts but to show them ways to navigate the regulatory pathways and related issues, which impact every phase of the creation and growth of a Life Sciences company. For the most part, students will not examine the issues surrounding the growth of provider or service businesses such as hospitals but instead explore the issues related to businesses built around proprietary technology. Topic samples: the history and evolution of regulation in this country and why it has evolved differently in other countries; cosmetics, cosmeceuticals, and food and how these areas are coming under increasing scrutiny by regulators; how to finance a drug versus a device company; and emerging technologies' issues.

One class day will be treated as a real-time modeling studio, where the class works together on a task provided in a one-page case at the beginning of class. New methodology will treat risk preference, risk management, correlated variables and scenarios, risk exposure, dynamic uncertainty models, Optquest for optimization within simulation models, and the decision quality process used in decision consulting. Students will use Excel and a number of add-in software products."

This course and Management Decision Models are intended for students interested in further core Decision Analysis instruction and is designed for those students who were comfortable with Decision Analysis and wish to pick up where it left off without significant overlap. Students who feel the need for significant review and reinforcement of the Decision Analysis content with modest extensions will benefit from this course. Thus, those students who made an A or B+ in Decision Analysis probably will find that this course does not meet your educational objectives and should consider a course that is more appropriate.

All this means addressing not only such traditional 'environmental' problems as preserving biodiversity, upgrading air and water quality, and countering global warming, but also addressing such 'non-environmental' questions as how best to defend human rights, create an alternative to 'consumerism', restructure the contemporary corporation, combat pandemics like HIV/AIDS, alleviate  'world hunger', reform energy policies,  and assess the welcome and unwelcome consequences of  both globalization and nationalism.  Indeed, some type of long term 'social revolution' is being contemplated under the banner of 'Sustainability'.  What would be the ethical justification for such dramatic change?
