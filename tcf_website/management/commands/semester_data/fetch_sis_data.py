"""
This script downloads data from SIS API and converts it into
a usable CSV file. However, in its current state we have to
manually hardcode the year/season of the semester(s) we want to
download.

Potential todo: create a cron job that runs this script and
`load_semester` every now and then so we don't have to do this.
