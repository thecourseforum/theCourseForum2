Approximately five independently developed short animations constitute the work of the semester, culminating in a one- to five-minute long final movie project. It is anticipated that an interdisciplinary group of students admitted to the seminar will bring perspectives from across the visual and design arts. Movie projects may range in creative subject areas. Built and landscape architectural places may be experienced according to our own changing eye point of view, the transformation of light and objects, as well as the movement of other people. Story telling, whether by means of simple character animation or more complex scene description, may related to these contextual aspects of either real or imagined environments. This subject is more exclusively focused than ARCH 5450 on animation as a means to creative moviemaking. Prerequisite: ARCH 3410/6410 or Instructor Permission."

We use traditional methods (watercolor or ink on paper, acrylics on canvas) as well as more unusual tools and materials (sidewalk chalk, earth, trash, recycled materials).  Through weekly readings and discussions we explore the relationship between aesthetics and ethics between 'good forms' and forms that in some way contribute or allude to the 'common good.'"

In addition, the course introduces derivative securities (options, futures) and discusses their application in a wide variety of settings (real options, contingent claims valuation of equity).

Students will explore such traditional issues as revenue recognition, inventory valuation, and leases, and such contemporary issues as mergers and acquisitions, intangibles, and financial derivatives. Although the primary focus of the course will be on accounting and reporting practices in the United States, students will also address selected differences between U.S. accounting standards and international accounting standards. How the major accounting scandals that have occurred in recent years have affected the financial reporting process and those who have the responsibility for insuring the accuracy of a company's published financial statements will also be addressed.

The course consists of four modules. Short-Term Financing and Working Capital Management and Capital Structure Policy are two that look at a series of policy issues that confront CFOs in the course of their day-to-day operations. Topics addressed in these two modules range from forecasting short-term financial needs to assessing the impact of alternative capital structures upon the implementation of corporate strategy. The final two modules, Mergers and Acquisitions and Restructuring and Bankruptcy, examine the role of financial analysis in effecting value-enhancing corporate transitions. Topics addressed range from the identification and quantification of merger synergies to the key strategic and procedural aspects of U.S. bankruptcy filings. Occasionally, the course also harnesses some of the more advanced techniques presented in the First Year Valuation in Financial Markets course. Each case, however, adopts a strictly managerial perspective, utilizing advanced techniques only as they prove necessary to solve specific managerial problems.

The valuation tools considered begin with basic arbitrage relationships and from there students will develop the Black-Scholes model. The course will also introduce the binomial approach and will use it as the primary valuation framework throughout the course.

During the course, students will utilize business simulations to design new managerial policies aimed at improving performance and testing alternative business scenarios.

For the most part, students will not examine the issues surrounding the growth of provider or service businesses such as hospitals but instead explore the issues related to businesses built around proprietary technology. Topic samples: the history and evolution of regulation in this country and why it has evolved differently in other countries; cosmetics, cosmeceuticals, and food and how these areas are coming under increasing scrutiny by regulators; how to finance a drug versus a device company; and emerging technologies' issues.

For students choosing an intrapreneurial career within a corporation, this experience will allow them to appreciate the benefits of corporate support. A student (or students, if a team) who request the 4.5-credit-hour (180 working hours per student) option are required to submit an analytical document that answers a critical path question in the determination of the viability of a business, which should form the basis for a determination if the student plans to pursue this business as full-time employment after graduation. A student (or students, if a team) may request the 3-credit-hour option if they do not see the critical path question being addressed in this Darden Business Project course as pertaining directly to their involvement after graduation in the business being analyzed or if they want to experience analyzing a critical path problem for an entrepreneurial venture."

The ability to communicate with individual customers often allows the marketer to measure and manage each customer relationship separately.
