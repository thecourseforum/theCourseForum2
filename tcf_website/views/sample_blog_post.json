The lovely engineering team has pulled out the top 5 rated courses at UVA after an analysis of the average rate given to classes taken by previous students. Thanks to the students who have taken the time to leave reviews of the classes they have completed each semester, whether that be good or bad, we were able to compile the most pursued courses at UVA. Without further ado, let’s take a look!\n\n\n1. Dracula (SLAV 2360)\n\nStanding at number 1... is Dracula! I mean who wouldn’t want to take a class called Dracula? Dracula is an introductory class into Slavic folklore with special emphasis on the origins and subsequent manifestations of vampirism. Western perceptions, misperceptions, and adaptations of Slavic culture are explored and explicated with an interdisciplinary approach. I’ve only heard GREAT things about this class and everyone knows it’s very, very difficult to get into. So, who will be the next elite group to get into Dracula? Hopefully, you!\n\n\n2. Black Writers in America (ENLT 2547)\n\nAt number 2, we have Black Writers in America. This class portrays topics in African-American writing in the US from its beginning in vernacular culture to the present day with topics varying from year to year. I’d say this is a perfect class to gain more perspective and cultural understanding of literature from the great African-American writers of the past. Also, the top review mentioned the course covering Beyonce... Do I need to say more?\n\n\n3. Workshop in Contemporary American Electoral Politics (PLAP 3370)\n\nThe title says it all! At number 3, we have Workshop in Contemporary American Electoral Politics. This class provides students with the opportunity to be directly involved with the research, programming, operations, and outreach of the University's non-profit, non-partisan Center for Politics. The class also orients different projects focused on state and national politics, political history, civic engagement, voter behavior, media and politics, campaign finance and political analysis. If you’re interested in politics, it’s definitely a perfect way to get hands-on experience through utilizing UVA’s resources with your peers!\n\n\n4. Greek and Roman Warfare (HIEU 3021)\n\nAt number 4, we have Greek and Roman Warfare. I’ve always been a big fan of Greek and Roman history and there couldn’t be a more perfect way to study history than through the study of WAR! This class surveys the history of ancient warfare from the Homeric era until the fall of Rome. I’m actually the current Student Tech Assistant for Professor Lendon so I get to see his lectures *in-person*! He is very experienced and knowledgeable in this subject area and his passion for teaching is amplified in his lectures. There is also a great number of people that show up to his *optional* in-person lecture option - that means this class is definitely worth rolling out of bed, leaving your house, and actually going to class!!\n\n\n5. Learn to Groove (MUSI 2340)\n\nLast but not least, at number 5 we have Learn to Groove. I think the title basically explains it all. This class is notoriously known to always be high in demand and has all the buzz! I personally heard about this class when I was touring UVA before first year when we saw a group of students carrying their bongos around Grounds. Of course, everyone was mesmerized at the fact that there was a class dedicated to teaching you how to literally GROOVE! This class presents you with the study of rhythmic patterns associated with rhythms from West African, the Caribbean, Brazil, and the United States, through theory and performance. All you need is a hand drum! (and to hopefully get off the waitlist.)\n\nThanks for *virtually* making your way down theCourseForum’s Hall of Fame with me. That concludes the overview of the top 5 courses at UVA ranked and brought to you by UVA students. Please feel free to browse through the rest of our website to check out more reviews of these or any classes of your interests! If you have a class that you love or hate, leave a review and help fellow Hoos select their future classes. Didn’t see a course that you love up here? Don’t gatekeep your favorite class or professor and leave a review! Thank you to all our Hoos who have contributed to the documentation of theCourseForum’s first Hall of Fame. Hope to see you in at least one of the most on-demand classes in your 4 years at UVA! :)"
