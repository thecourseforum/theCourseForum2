## How to Contribute
If you are part of theCourseForum engineering team, follow the instructions below to create a PR for your feature branch. If you are a UVA student and would like to contribute, contact one of the current contributors.

### Directions
1. Create a new branch to do your work in off of the `dev` branch.
    - `git pull`
    - `git checkout dev`
    - `git checkout -B your_branch_name`
2. Make your changes!
3. Write unit tests and put them in `tcf_website/tests/`
4. Lint and test locally before commit:
    - `./precommit`
    - Fix any problems indicated by tests or pylint.
        - `docker exec tcf_django python3 manage.py test`
        - `docker exec tcf_django pylint --load-plugins pylint_django tcf_website tcf_core`
4. Stage your changes with `git add .`
5. Commit with `git commit -m "Add X feature."`
6. Push! `git push`
7. Make a PR (Pull Request) to merge your changes back into the `dev` branch.
8. Wait for all tests to pass on Travis (indicated by green checkmark).
9. Request an approver.
10. Wait to be approved and merged!

### Design Philosophies
- Thick models, thin views, thinner templates
    - most application logic should be in methods on model classes.
        - this ensures that the code can be reused easily anywhere the model is used and is way easier to test.
    - furthermore, you should avoid placing logic in templates.
        - e.g. don't filter lists in templates, filter them in the views.


## Setup
### MacOS and Linux Setup
1. Install git, docker, and docker-compose
    - https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git
    - https://docs.docker.com/install/
    - https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/
2. Clone the git repository and cd into the project folder
    ```
        git clone https://github.com/thecourseforum/theCourseForum2.git
        cd theCourseForum2
    ```
3. Copy the [project secret keys](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HsuJOf-5oZljQK_k02CQhFbqw1q-pD_1-mExvyC1TV0/edit?usp=sharing) into a `.env` file in the project base directory `theCourseForum2/`
4. In the `theCourseForum2/` directory, run `docker-compose up` to start your Docker containers (tCF Django app and database)
5. Download a copy of the database from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ubiiOj-jfzoBKaMK6pFEkFXdSqMuD-22)
    - put this into the base `theCourseForum2/` directory
6. While your container is still running, open a second terminal, cd into `theCourseForum2/`, and run this script to set up your database*:
    - `./load_data ${DB}` 
    - where `${DB}` should be replaced with the latest DB file (e.g. `./load_data april7.sql`)
7. Go to http://localhost:8000 in your browser and make sure everything works!

\* If you're on Windows, you'll specifically need to use a bash shell (e.g. PowerShell or Git Bash) as normal CMD doesn't have the `cat` command which is used by the script.
### Alternative Setup (Windows and MacOS if above failed)
0. [Install Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/intro/getting-started/install.html)
1. `git clone https://github.com/thecourseforum/theCourseForum2.git`
2. Go into the `theCourseForum2/` folder and then run `vagrant up` to start a VM.
3. After that's booted, run `vagrant ssh` to run commands inside the VM.
4. `cd /vagrant`
5. Start at step 3 in normal setup. You may have to prefix all docker commands with `sudo` (e.g. `sudo docker-compose up`).
6. Go to http://127.0.0.1:8000 and make sure it works!
7. Run `vagrant` suspend when you're done to suspend the VM.


## Common Issues and Fixes

### Database Issues
If the 'Browse Courses' page isn't loading, try the following:
1. Check to see if postgres is running
    ```
    docker-compose exec web bash            # Exec into db container
    ps auxwww | grep postgres               # Check postgres processes
    ```
    If it outputs only one line, postgres is not running. 
    - MacOS: Restart it with Homebrew: `brew services start postgresql`
    - Linux: `sudo service postgresql restart`
2. There may be a Django migration issue. See the section below this for details.
3. If all else fails, reset the development database by dropping the table and re-running the Setup instructions.
    First run `sudo docker exec -i tcf_db psql -U tcf_django tcf_db` which will put you into the Postgres terminal (no message will be given)
    ```
    SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pg_stat_activity.pid)
    FROM pg_stat_activity
    WHERE pg_stat_activity.datname = 'tcf_db'
    AND pid <> pg_backend_pid();
    ```
    Exit the terminal with Ctrl-C or Ctrl-D
    Then run the following commands to drop and recreate the database
    ```
    sudo docker exec -i tcf_db dropdb -U tcf_django tcf_db
    sudo docker exec -i tcf_db createdb -U tcf_django tcf_db
    ```

### Django Migration Conflicts
After we removed the migrations folder from the `.gitignore` file, you may experience migration issues when you merge different branches where the models (database tables/columns) have been modified. Try the following to resolve the issue:

#### Local Development:
1. Delete everything in tcf_website/migrations EXCEPT for `__init__.py`.
    - If you accidentally delete this file, recreate an empty file with the same name. Migrations will not update without this file.
2. Delete everything in your `__pycache__` directories
3. While your container for the Django application is running, re-run migrations commands below:
```
docker-compose exec web bash
python3 manage.py makemigrations
python3 manage.py migrate
```
4. If all else fails, reset the development database by dropping the table and re-running the Database Setup instructions.

    First run `sudo docker exec -i tcf_db psql -U tcf_django tcf_db` which will put you into the Postgres terminal (no message will be given)
    ```
    SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pg_stat_activity.pid)
    FROM pg_stat_activity
    WHERE pg_stat_activity.datname = 'tcf_db'
    AND pid <> pg_backend_pid();
    ```
    Exit the terminal with Ctrl-C or Ctrl-D
    Then run the following commands to drop and recreate the database
    ```
    sudo docker exec -i tcf_db dropdb -U tcf_django tcf_db
    sudo docker exec -i tcf_db createdb -U tcf_django tcf_db
    ```

## Site Update Guides

### Data migration plan from tCF 1.0 (total downtime: 2.5 hours)
1. Get latest copy of legacy db using `mysqldump` from DO instance.
2. Convert to sqlite using `legacy_db/mysql2sqlite`
    - Then put in `settings.py` as database `legacy`
3. `docker exec -it tcf_django bash` and then `python manage.py migrate_legacy_subdepartments`
4. `python manage.py load_all_semesters`
5. `python manage.py migrate_legacy_reviews`
6. `docker exec tcf_db pg_dump -U tcf_django -Fc tcf_db > dump.pgsql`
7. Test
    - Maybe crawl tCF and check that all viewable reviews are on the new system.
8. Upload to DigitalOcean DB.
    - `PGPASSWORD=$DB_PASS pg_restore -U $DB_USER -h $DB_HOST -p 25060 -d $DB_NAME < dump.pgsql`
    - You may have to run this command 3 times.

### New semester update plan
1. `python manage.py update_semester 2021 january`
    - fetches CSV from lous list
    - loads section data into database
        - update courses with new course info if available
        - create new instructors if needed
