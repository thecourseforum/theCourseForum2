        "question": "Why the switch to tCF 2.0?",
        "answer": "The previous version of theCourseForum was developed using the Ruby on Rails framework in 2012, over 8 years ago. That's a long time in tech years! Not many of our student developers know Ruby anymore, so we rebuilt the site from scratch with Django, a popular Python web framework that's taught in UVA's CS 3240 (Advanced Software Development). What this means for you is that it's easier for us in the long term to maintain the site and develop new features for you."
    },
    {
        "question": "Where did [previous feature] go?",
        "answer": "During our tCF2.0 rewrite, some features had to be left out due to low usage. If you'd like to propose we bring one of them back, or suggest an entirely new feature, submit a feedback form or join the discussion on our <a href=\"https://discord.gg/tAjzH7eyvW\" class=\"text-tcf-blue\">Discord server<\/a>!"
    },
    {
        "question": "Do you profit from people using the site?",
        "answer": "No, our site is entirely a student volunteer effort. This has been a subject of confusion in the past, so to be clear: We have never and will never make money from the site. We get our money from university grants, sponsors, and donations from users like you!"
    },
    {
        "question": "Where does your grade data come from?",
        "answer": "We use completely anonymized official grade data from UVA! Don't worry, nobody will find out about the C you got in MATH 1200."
