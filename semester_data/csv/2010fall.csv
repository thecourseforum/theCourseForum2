It draws heavily upon analytical techniques provided in the First Year Financial Management and Policies course and deepens and extends the core theory introduced in that course by examining its application to many of the key policy challenges that confront public corporations. The course consists of four modules. Short-Term Financing and Working Capital Management and Capital Structure Policy are two that look at a series of policy issues that confront CFOs in the course of their day-to-day operations. Topics addressed in these two modules range from forecasting short-term financial needs to assessing the impact of alternative capital structures upon the implementation of corporate strategy. The final two modules, Mergers and Acquisitions and Restructuring and Bankruptcy, examine the role of financial analysis in effecting value-enhancing corporate transitions. Topics addressed range from the identification and quantification of merger synergies to the key strategic and procedural aspects of U.S. bankruptcy filings. Occasionally, the course also harnesses some of the more advanced techniques presented in the First Year Valuation in Financial Markets course. Each case, however, adopts a strictly managerial perspective, utilizing advanced techniques only as they prove necessary to solve specific managerial problems.

The valuation tools considered begin with basic arbitrage relationships and from there students will develop the Black-Scholes model. The course will also introduce the binomial approach and will use it as the primary valuation framework throughout the course. Students will also, through the use of assignments and problem sets, develop an intuitive understanding of why these products are used and the fundamental relationships that underlay all derivative products."

Students will learn a new approach to communicating with others and benefit from learning to utilize a system-design approach for facilitating discussions aimed at developing new mental models of complex business systems. During the course, students will utilize business simulations to design new managerial policies aimed at improving performance and testing alternative business scenarios. The course is highly participatory, relying on workshops, simulations, and interaction with classmates and guest speakers to complement readings, cases, and exercises. Throughout the course, special emphasis is placed on the ability to communicate with others to build a shared understanding of business processes, decisions, and business performance insights.

In this industry, whether Biotech or Devices, the consumer of products, the patient, does not choose the product, pay for it, or have any say about what products are available. This is a unique environment in which anyone involved needs to have a working knowledge of the philosophy, terminology, and processes their clients, companies, or products will have to follow. The course is not designed to make students regulatory experts but to show them ways to navigate the regulatory pathways and related issues, which impact every phase of the creation and growth of a Life Sciences company. For the most part, students will not examine the issues surrounding the growth of provider or service businesses such as hospitals but instead explore the issues related to businesses built around proprietary technology. Topic samples: the history and evolution of regulation in this country and why it has evolved differently in other countries; cosmetics, cosmeceuticals, and food and how these areas are coming under increasing scrutiny by regulators; how to finance a drug versus a device company; and emerging technologies' issues.

Issues related to the measurement of returns in private equity funds, valuing enterprises at different stages of development, and structuring deals using various forms of financing are covered as well as the analytical methods to better measure performance and value enterprises. Students will examine how each party's view of the value of the enterprise forms a basis for negotiation upon which the percentage of equity participation and the terms of the contract are determined as well as how the pricing and terms depend not only the deal itself but also upon prevailing market conditions.

In this full-semester course, students prepare for the challenges posed by the increased use of teams in the workplace while working directly with first-year learning teams as the teams evolve throughout the first semester. The relationship formed with a student's first-year team and documented through weekly required observations becomes a live and continuing case throughout the term. The first part of the course focuses on the learning team's evolution, supplemented by ongoing delivery of relevant group theory. The second part of the course broadens the focus to include the contemporary issues and challenges of workplace teams, such as leading your group at work, managing coordinating teams in strategic alliances, and teaching others to be better team members. The course is most successful when students commit the time and energy needed to maintain weekly contact with their team and remain open to learning about themselves and others in the process."
