We stress the process rather then the artistic product and, like artist Sol LeWitt, define painting 'as an activity on a flat plane.' We make plane (and plain) images: configurations of relatively stable, still marks on two-dimensional surfaces. We use traditional methods (watercolor or ink on paper, acrylics on canvas) as well as more unusual tools and materials (sidewalk chalk, earth, trash, recycled materials). Through weekly readings and discussions we explore the relationship between aesthetics and ethics between 'good forms' and forms that in some way contribute or allude to the 'common good.'",
