The major goals of the course are to familiarize students with key research areas of importance for training as physician scientists, and to develop the student's presentation skills. Students are required to give a minimum of one oral presentation per year to their fellow students and to selected faculty members who have expertise in the area of presentation. Students also are required to attend presentations of other students and to participate in group discussions. In addition to research presentations by students, there will also be presentations by faculty members in areas of significance for training of physician scientists. Grading (S/U) will be based on the quality of the students' presentation, as well as the extent of their participation in group discussions."

We focus on the two fundamental aspects of financial decision-making: time value and risk (modern portfolio theory, the capital asset pricing model, and alternatives). The concepts of time value and risk are used to value the two basic financial assets, bonds and stocks, as well as real assets, investment projects, and companies. In addition, the course introduces derivative securities (options, futures) and discusses their application in a wide variety of settings (real options, contingent claims valuation of equity). The course also covers the theory and practice of capital structure decisions (Modigliani and Miller, taxes, bankruptcy costs, asymmetric information, agency) and dividend decisions. The course will include a thorough discussion of market efficiency and an introduction to the field of behavioral finance. A unifying theme of the course is how no-arbitrage conditions and the law of one price can be used to value most financial assets.

Ethics addresses the conflicts of values involved in decisions about the environment. The balancing of environmental and economic costs and benefits, coupled with human beliefs about what is 'right' or 'wrong,' is at the heart of the environmental decision-making process. The process is complex because it involves a diverse set of stakeholders with differing perspectives and objectives.

Students will explore the ways in which corporate communications align key messages to multiple stakeholders and assist in the management of crises; the process of building reputation and corporate brand; the reasons why new information about the impact of communication enhances the quality of managers' decision-making ability; and how the growing role of corporate citizenship and environmental sustainability in corporations plays a significant, if sometimes controversial, part in managing reputation. At no time in the recent past have so many issues threatened corporate reputation. Therefore, the area of corporate communication is particularly relevant to all future managers.

This knowledge adds value in two respects. First, it facilitates communication with lawyers and understanding the advice they provide. Second, it demonstrates a way of analyzing problems that is different from, but complementary to, those taught in core business courses. The course begins with an overview of the foundational topics of the American legal system: the law of contracts, property, and torts. It then moves to substantive areas that managers routinely encounter, such as corporate governance, bankruptcy, intellectual property, and antitrust. The course examines the structure of the court systems and legal profession in the United States and provides some comparative analysis of other legal systems.

Students will examine how each party's view of the value of the enterprise forms a basis for negotiation upon which the percentage of equity participation and the terms of the contract are determined as well as how the pricing and terms depend not only the deal itself but also upon prevailing market conditions. As private equity firms are either rapidly growing or changing organizations, students will learn that there must be sufficient flexibility and appropriate incentives built into the current round of capital raising and the contract terms to carry the firm through its next stage of development."

The name of the course accurately describes its contents: strategic management of organizations that create and deliver financial products. There are several reasons for studying the strategic management challenges of financial service organizations. First, this aspect of financial service organizations management has been the make-or-break decision for financial service organizations in recent years. Some segments of the financial service industry end up with capital needs, and others find themselves with surplus but expensive capital. Either problem can be fatal. Once the strategy has been selected, however, the implementation decisions, although not necessarily the implementation itself, are comparatively straightforward. Second, the strategic perspective permits the course much broader scope than would the alternative of concentrating in depth on a narrower set of institutions in order to cover all aspects of management. Broad perspective is also important for the course to make the maximum contribution to the career decisions of students considering jobs with financial service organizations, institutions that are not as closely examined in the corporate-finance focus of the first-year curriculum."

The ability to communicate with individual customers often allows the marketer to measure and manage each customer relationship separately. The results of response advertising campaigns are also measurable, testable, and data-base driven, thus converting the abstract aspect of marketing into the universal language of numbers.
