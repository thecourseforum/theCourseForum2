Movie projects may range in creative subject areas. Built and landscape architectural places may be experienced according to our own changing eye point of view, the transformation of light and objects, as well as the movement of other people. Story telling, whether by means of simple character animation or more complex scene description, may related to these contextual aspects of either real or imagined environments.

The concepts of time value and risk are used to value the two basic financial assets, bonds and stocks, as well as real assets, investment projects, and companies. In addition, the course introduces derivative securities (options, futures) and discusses their application in a wide variety of settings (real options, contingent claims valuation of equity). The course also covers the theory and practice of capital structure decisions (Modigliani and Miller, taxes, bankruptcy costs, asymmetric information, agency) and dividend decisions. The course will include a thorough discussion of market efficiency and an introduction to the field of behavioral finance. A unifying theme of the course is how no-arbitrage conditions and the law of one price can be used to value most financial assets.

Although the primary focus of the course will be on accounting and reporting practices in the United States, students will also address selected differences between U.S. accounting standards and international accounting standards. How the major accounting scandals that have occurred in recent years have affected the financial reporting process and those who have the responsibility for insuring the accuracy of a company's published financial statements will also be addressed.

The primary purpose of the course is to teach students how to interpret and value the wide variety of derivatives products available. As such, the course examines a broad array of derivative products that range from basic futures contracts to the more specialized products developed for interest-rate markets. The valuation tools considered begin with basic arbitrage relationships and from there students will develop the Black-Scholes model. The course will also introduce the binomial approach and will use it as the primary valuation framework throughout the course. Students will also, through the use of assignments and problem sets, develop an intuitive understanding of why these products are used and the fundamental relationships that underlay all derivative products."

Students will learn a new approach to communicating with others and benefit from learning to utilize a system-design approach for facilitating discussions aimed at developing new mental models of complex business systems. During the course, students will utilize business simulations to design new managerial policies aimed at improving performance and testing alternative business scenarios. The course is highly participatory, relying on workshops, simulations, and interaction with classmates and guest speakers to complement readings, cases, and exercises. Throughout the course, special emphasis is placed on the ability to communicate with others to build a shared understanding of business processes, decisions, and business performance insights.

In this industry, whether Biotech or Devices, the consumer of products, the patient, does not choose the product, pay for it, or have any say about what products are available. This is a unique environment in which anyone involved needs to have a working knowledge of the philosophy, terminology, and processes their clients, companies, or products will have to follow. The course is not designed to make students regulatory experts but to show them ways to navigate the regulatory pathways and related issues, which impact every phase of the creation and growth of a Life Sciences company. For the most part, students will not examine the issues surrounding the growth of provider or service businesses such as hospitals but instead explore the issues related to businesses built around proprietary technology. Topic samples: the history and evolution of regulation in this country and why it has evolved differently in other countries; cosmetics, cosmeceuticals, and food and how these areas are coming under increasing scrutiny by regulators; how to finance a drug versus a device company; and emerging technologies' issues.

In this full-semester course, students prepare for the challenges posed by the increased use of teams in the workplace while working directly with first-year learning teams as the teams evolve throughout the first semester. The relationship formed with a student's first-year team and documented through weekly required observations becomes a live and continuing case throughout the term. The first part of the course focuses on the learning team's evolution, supplemented by ongoing delivery of relevant group theory. The second part of the course broadens the focus to include the contemporary issues and challenges of workplace teams, such as leading your group at work, managing coordinating teams in strategic alliances, and teaching others to be better team members. The course is most successful when students commit the time and energy needed to maintain weekly contact with their team and remain open to learning about themselves and others in the process."

Today many writers speak of a 21st century 'sustainability revolution' which aims at: 1) 'correcting' the negative environmental consequences of the industrial revolution, 2) continuing with but redefining 'economic growth', and 3) moving beyond the relatively narrow concerns of late 20th century 'environmentalism' by integrating environmental issues into issues of social and economic justice.  All this means addressing not only such traditional 'environmental' problems as preserving biodiversity, upgrading air and water quality, and countering global warming, but also addressing such 'non-environmental' questions as how best to defend human rights, create an alternative to 'consumerism', restructure the contemporary corporation, combat pandemics like HIV/AIDS, alleviate  'world hunger', reform energy policies,  and assess the welcome and unwelcome consequences of  both globalization and nationalism.  Indeed, some type of long term 'social revolution' is being contemplated under the banner of 'Sustainability'.  What would be the ethical justification for such dramatic change?  Is it really necessary for human survival or the quality of human life?  Is it politically feasible even in the long term?  Such broad questions will be examined."
