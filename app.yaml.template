# Google App Engine Config

runtime: python37

# The --http flag exposes the app with uWSGI only and will act as the router/proxy/load balancer
# If we want an nginx webserver upstream for more features, we would have to use a --socket flag so that nginx can communicate with uWSGI
# More info here: https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/Django_and_nginx.html
entrypoint: uwsgi --http :8080 --module tcf_core.wsgi --master --processes 1 --threads 2
