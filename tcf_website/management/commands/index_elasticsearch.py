    Author: Bradley Knaysi

    Created: April 19th, 2020

    How To Use:

        $ cd theCourseForum2/
        $ docker-compose up

        open a new terminal

        $ cd theCourseForum2/
        $ docker exec -it tcf_django bash
        $ python3 manage.py index_elasticsearch

    WARNING: This should only be done by an Executive Team member each semester
    after new course and instructor data are added to the tcf_db. Note that the
    Elastic portal takes 1 to 2 minutes to fully reflect changes. You can run this as
    many times as you want! It updates a document in Elastic if it already exists and
    adds the document if it didn't. Additionally, this can only be run from a production
    environment due to its reliance on production environment variables (tcf secrets).
