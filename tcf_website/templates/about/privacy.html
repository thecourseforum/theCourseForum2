If you are under 13, please do not attempt to register for theCourseForum or send any information about yourself to us, including your name or email address. No one under age 13 may provide any personal information to or on theCourseForum.

    We recommend that minors over the age of 13 ask their parents for permission before sending any information about themselves to anyone over the Internet.

    <h4>Use of Information Obtained by theCourseForum</h4>
    <p>When you register with theCourseForum, you create your own account. Your account information, as well as your name and email, are not displayed to other Users. We may occasionally use your name and email address to send you notifications regarding new services offered by theCourseForum that we think you may find valuable.</p>

    <p>Account information is used by theCourseForum primarily to be presented back to and edited by you when you access the service.</p>

    <p>theCourseForum may send you service-related announcements from time to time through the general operation of the service.</p>

    <p>theCourseForum may use information in your account without identifying you as an individual to third parties. We do this for purposes such as aggregating how many people in a class recommend a professor and personalizing advertisements and promotions so that we can provide you with theCourseForum.</p>

    <p>Sharing Your Information with Third Parties</p>

    <p>theCourseForum is about sharing information with fellow students while providing you with privacy settings that restrict other users from accessing your information. We do not provide contact information to third party marketers without your permission. We share your information with third parties only in limited circumstances where we believe such sharing is 1) reasonably necessary to offer the service, 2) legally required or, 3) permitted by you. For example:</p>

    <ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 30px;">
      <li>We may provide information to service providers to help us bring you the services we offer. Specifically, we may use third parties to facilitate our business, such as to host the service at a hosting facility for servers, to send out email updates about theCourseForum, to remove repetitive information from our user lists, or to provide search results or links (including sponsored links). In connection with these offerings and business operations, our service providers may have access to your personal information for use for a limited time in connection with these business activities. Where we utilize third parties for the processing of any personal information, we implement reasonable contractual and technical protections limiting the use of that information to theCourseForum-specified purposes.</li>
      <li>We occasionally provide demonstration accounts that allow non-users a glimpse into the theCourseForum world. Such accounts have only limited capabilities (e.g., reviewing is disabled) and passwords are changed regularly to limit possible misuse.</li>
      <li>We may be required to disclose user information pursuant to lawful requests, such as subpoenas or court orders, or in compliance with applicable laws. We do not reveal information until we have a good faith belief that an information request by law enforcement or private litigants meets applicable legal standards. Additionally, we may share account or other information when we believe it is necessary to comply with law, to protect our interests or property, to prevent fraud or other illegal activity perpetrated through theCourseForum service or using the theCourseForum name, or to prevent imminent bodily harm. This may include sharing information with other companies, lawyers, agents or government agencies. We may offer stores or provide services jointly with other companies on theCourseForum. You can tell when another company is involved in any store or service provided on theCourseForum, and we may share customer information with that company in connection with your use of that store or service.</li>
      <li>If the ownership of all or substantially all of the theCourseForum business, or individual business units owned by theCourseForum, were to change, your user information may be transferred to the new owner so the service can continue operations. In any such transfer of information, your user information would remain subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Policy.</li>
    </ul>
