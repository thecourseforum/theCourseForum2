Beginning with the basic principles of genetics, this course examines the use of molecular methods to study gene expression and its critical role in health and disease. Topics include DNA replication, transcription, translation, recombinant DNA methodology, methods for analyzing gene expression (including microarray and genechip analysis), methods for creating genetically-engineered mice, and methods for accomplishing gene therapy by direct in vivo gene transfer. Prerequisite: BME 6103, undergraduate-level cell and/or molecular biology course. (e.g., BME 2104) or instructor permission. Suggested preparation: biochemistry, cell biology, genetics, and physiology.."

Physics and modeling techniques used in ultrasound transducers. Brief review of ID circuit transducer models. Use of Finite Element techniques in transducer design. Design considerations for 1.5D and 2D arrays will be reviewed. Diffraction and beamforming will be introduced starting from Huygen's principle. FIELD propagation model will form an important part of the class. In depth discussion of various beamforming and imaging issues such as sidelobes, apodization, grating lobes, resolution, contrast, etc. The course addresses attenuation, time-gain-compensation and refraction. Finally, speckle statistics and K-Space techniques will be introduced. Laboratories will involve measuring ultrasound image metrics, examining the effect of various beamforming parameters and simulating these on a computer using Matlab. Prerequisite: instructor permission, BIOM 6310 and BIOM 6311.

The course draws heavily from the key concepts, frameworks, and tools of strategic management. Taking an action orientation, it reinforces and revitalizes the general-management perspective, the core mission of the school. Because of increasing global interdependence and an ever-shifting business environment, it emphasizes both the dynamics and the global aspects of strategic management. Topics include developing and evaluating strategy, building firm capability and sustaining competitive advantage, analyzing industry evolution and global rivalry, and linking strategy and execution. Course objectives are accomplished through exposure to cases from a range of industries and managerial settings. By providing students with an opportunity to apply analytical skills they learn in various first-year courses, the course fosters an integrative mind-set that will enable MBAs to operate at multiple levels and in different functions in their business careers."

Second, it demonstrates a way of analyzing problems that is different from, but complementary to, those taught in core business courses. The course begins with an overview of the foundational topics of the American legal system: the law of contracts, property, and torts. It then moves to substantive areas that managers routinely encounter, such as corporate governance, bankruptcy, intellectual property, and antitrust. The course examines the structure of the court systems and legal profession in the United States and provides some comparative analysis of other legal systems.

Understanding the relative nature of this dynamic process is the key to building and sustaining competitive advantage. The seminar is designed to develop an appreciation for cutting-edge academic research and its application to pertinent competitive issues, which is an essential skill for managers responsible for developing and implementing business strategies and for consultants advising such managers. Participants will be expected to abstract larger strategic issues from financial and operational particulars and to apply the concepts, analytical tools, and research methods learned in class to an intensive project on competition.
