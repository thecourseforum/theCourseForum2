We use traditional methods (watercolor or ink on paper, acrylics on canvas) as well as more unusual tools and materials (sidewalk chalk, earth, trash, recycled materials).

Because of increasing global interdependence and an ever-shifting business environment, it emphasizes both the dynamics and the global aspects of strategic management. Topics include developing and evaluating strategy, building firm capability and sustaining competitive advantage, analyzing industry evolution and global rivalry, and linking strategy and execution. Course objectives are accomplished through exposure to cases from a range of industries and managerial settings.

Many internships end with a presentation or report and seek three capabilities: mastery of key MBA concepts, solving an enterprise level problem, and superior communication skills. By moving from analysis to articulation and implementation, the communication perspective is especially suited to integrating key concepts in order to solve larger analytical problems. This class will use cases as a basis for such daily exercises as media training, financial conference calls, and action plan pitches and will conclude with a substantive presentation driven by student interests."

Through large and small group discussions of cases and readings, various experiential activities, body awareness and movement exercises, journaling and free writing, guided meditation, and individual reflection, each student will have the opportunity to discover what is true for them and move forward with that knowledge. Before the start of the course, each student is required to choose, read, and summarize a book that is relevant to the course. Prerequisites: Restricted to Darden students."

Therefore this course provides a general understanding of the basic tax consequences of fundamental restructuring strategies and a framework for evaluating the priority that taxes have in these strategies. The course requires students to analyze how tax consequences affect the value of different strategies to the buyer and seller. Understanding the effect of taxes on the value of a deal to the buyer and seller prepares future financial executives and strategic advisors to make better decisions and to be more effective negotiators. Although the course focuses on the tax consequences of restructuring strategies and their valuation implications, it also covers the nontax advantages and disadvantages of these strategies. Most of the course covers U.S. federal income tax issues of restructuring of C corporations, but it also will address pass-through entities. Other topics will be entity formation, taxable asset and stock acquisitions, tax-free asset and stock reorganizations, and divestitures and liquidations.
