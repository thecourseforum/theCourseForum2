Ethics addresses the conflicts of values involved in decisions about the environment. The balancing of environmental and economic costs and benefits, coupled with human beliefs about what is 'right' or 'wrong,' is at the heart of the environmental decision-making process. The process is complex because it involves a diverse set of stakeholders with differing perspectives and objectives.

The course will focus primarily on data analysis, used to both gain useful insights into relationships and make better, more useful forecasts. In addition to more advanced treatment of regression analysis (the goal being for students to be able to build and apply sophisticated regression models), students will become familiar with other common approaches to forecasting, such as rudimentary time-series analysis. Students will also improve their ability to structure, analyze, and manage situations involving uncertainty and risk, using simulation (Crystal Ball), decision trees, and the other tools introduced in the required Decision Analysis course. Finally, the course will introduce students to the concepts of optimization using Excel's Solver add-in, used to determine how to optimally allocate resources in situations involving complex trade-offs."

This knowledge adds value in two respects. First, it facilitates communication with lawyers and understanding the advice they provide. Second, it demonstrates a way of analyzing problems that is different from, but complementary to, those taught in core business courses. The course begins with an overview of the foundational topics of the American legal system: the law of contracts, property, and torts. It then moves to substantive areas that managers routinely encounter, such as corporate governance, bankruptcy, intellectual property, and antitrust. The course examines the structure of the court systems and legal profession in the United States and provides some comparative analysis of other legal systems.

Understanding the relative nature of this dynamic process is the key to building and sustaining competitive advantage. The seminar is designed to develop an appreciation for cutting-edge academic research and its application to pertinent competitive issues, which is an essential skill for managers responsible for developing and implementing business strategies and for consultants advising such managers. Participants will be expected to abstract larger strategic issues from financial and operational particulars and to apply the concepts, analytical tools, and research methods learned in class to an intensive project on competition.

The approach integrates the fundamentals of materials science with essential concepts in solid state and condensed matter physics. Special attention is given to understanding the nature of the crystalline state and wave-particle diffraction with a strong emphasis on the reciprocal lattice concept. Thermal properties are approached by discussing the Einstein and Debye solids and the concept of lattice waves and phonons. The elements of Boltzmann, Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac statistics are reviewed leading to the development of an electron theory of solids. The concepts of Fermi surface and Fermi energy, Brillouin zones, valence and conduction bands are discussed extensively. The atomic origin of magnetism and magnetic effects in solids are analyzed as well as magnetic hysteresis and technical magnetic properties. The fundamental electrical and magnetic properties of superconductors are discussed including the new high Tc ceramic materials. Prerequisite: MSE 6140 or equivalent or instructor permission."
