@team Based on the responses to the When2Meet link sent a week ago, we have decided that the best meeting time for this year will be 2pm-3pm consistently on Saturdays. Our first meeting after fall break will be this Saturday, at 2pm, in Thornton Hall D115.
This was the time slot that best accommodated the most people, so if you have any hard conflicts with this time for every week, please let us know by email or in the Discord via the team channels so that we can find some way to resolve it.
