Students will examine how interest rates are impacted by such factors as central-bank behavior, fiscal policy, the state of the business cycle, productivity, inflation expectations, and international capital flows. For currencies, students will develop two related tool kits: one that is useful for understanding the drivers of orderly changes in exchange rates, and a second, through the construction of an early-warning system, that focuses on factors associated with large and potentially disorderly depreciations. Students will also investigate ways in which firms and investors manage interest-rate and currency exposure, as well as how countries manage exchange rates. The course, which includes both technical readings and cases, should appeal to a broad array of students, especially those who wish to pursue careers in investment banking, international finance, and general management."

Many internships end with a presentation or report and seek three capabilities: mastery of key MBA concepts, solving an enterprise level problem, and superior communication skills. By moving from analysis to articulation and implementation, the communication perspective is especially suited to integrating key concepts in order to solve larger analytical problems. This class will use cases as a basis for such daily exercises as media training, financial conference calls, and action plan pitches and will conclude with a substantive presentation driven by student interests."

Students will tackle the challenges and problems most businesses encounter in integrating acquisitions with the understanding that according to research 65% to 85% of most mergers fail. Students also will learn how to distinguish between different types of mergers and to discern the appropriate tools required for integrating two or more separate organizations. By the end of the course, students should be able to contribute to any post-merger-integration-strategy consulting engagement, corporate development activities, and M&A practices. Instruction for the course consists of cases, exercises, and a variety of readings from business and history."
19240,GBUS,8160,001,Lecture,"1.5","","","","Taxation of Mergers and Acquisitions","",Open,45,65,0,"Students who seek careers in investment banking, venture capital, corporate finance, and management consulting will find this course of interest. Although students pursuing these career paths do not need tax expertise, they do need to be able to evaluate critically when to call in the tax experts and what the tax experts are telling them. Therefore this course provides a general understanding of the basic tax consequences of fundamental restructuring strategies and a framework for evaluating the priority that taxes have in these strategies. The course requires students to analyze how tax consequences affect the value of different strategies to the buyer and seller. Understanding the effect of taxes on the value of a deal to the buyer and seller prepares future financial executives and strategic advisors to make better decisions and to be more effective negotiators. Although the course focuses on the tax consequences of restructuring strategies and their valuation implications, it also covers the nontax advantages and disadvantages of these strategies. Most of the course covers U.S. federal income tax issues of restructuring of C corporations, but it also will address pass-through entities. Other topics will be entity formation, taxable asset and stock acquisitions, tax-free asset and stock reorganizations, and divestitures and liquidations. The principal modes of instruction are cases, readings, articles, exercises, and a group project that allows students to investigate a specific deal of personal interest.  Prerequisites:  Restricted to Darden students."

Cases, guest lecturers, and students' project work will allow them to explore financial, legal, interpersonal, and personal challenges likely to be encountered by the independent entrepreneur. This course draws from cognitive science-based research on how expert entrepreneurs think, decide, and act while starting new ventures. Key issues addressed will include risk perception and management, formulation of innovative stakeholder relationships, and the creation of new markets through new ventures. As part of the course, students will be required to come up with a venture idea and take the initial steps in actually starting it. The course is recommended for those interested in initiating a personal venture at some point in their lives working with or consulting for an early stage entrepreneurial team or seeking entry into Darden's Progressive Incubator."

Although many MBA's are deciding that they would rather lead in smaller businesses than follow in large ones, by the end of this course they will see that 'a smaller business is not a little big business' and that managing a smaller enterprise is an art related to, but substantially different from, managing a large corporation. In the course, students will discover that the issues, challenges, and perspectives differ as much as the numbers in the financials as well as what happens after the start-up or acquisition of a firm. Typical issues addressed are finding a job with a smaller enterprise, the characteristics of the smaller enterprise, creating value as a smaller enterprise CEO, management transitions associated with stages of small business growth, challenges of finding, retaining, and losing employees, special issues and considerations in the family-owned business, franchising as a financing and growth mechanism, import-export operations and international dimensions of small business, ethical challenges of everyday life in the small firm, the balancing act of personal, family, and business realities of the smaller firm, and exiting a venture on your terms."

Second, it demonstrates a way of analyzing problems that is different from, but complementary to, those taught in core business courses. The course begins with an overview of the foundational topics of the American legal system: the law of contracts, property, and torts. It then moves to substantive areas that managers routinely encounter, such as corporate governance, bankruptcy, intellectual property, and antitrust. The course examines the structure of the court systems and legal profession in the United States and provides some comparative analysis of other legal systems.

The class will examine theater companies as high-performance teams and attempt to construct such teams throughout the course. The course draws on the expertise of the artistic community in Charlottesville by providing several technical workshops on acting and directing.  Prerequisites: Restricted to Darden students."

Both theoretical and applied/practical perspectives of crisis management will be addressed. Students will be exposed to multiple frameworks for managing crises and the tools and techniques for making sound leadership decisions before, during, and after crises hit. We will also examine crises as sources of organizational innovation and change. The course uses a variety of teaching methods, including case studies, current events, simulations, and guest speakers to illustrate key points and will draw on material from multiple functional areas including organizational behavior, strategy, marketing, and management communications. The course is particularly relevant to students preparing for the responsibilities of management and senior leadership."

It is a practical course for students who are interested in applying their knowledge to deal structuring, identifying and resolving legal and business concerns, negotiations, documentation, and deal closing. This course is offered by the University of Virginia School of Law and the Darden School and will be taught as a seminar with a combination of students from both schools. The short-form cases or caselets often place students inside the negotiating room and challenge them to negotiate with foreign ministers, senior military officials, provincial governors, and other counterparties. Each case involves one significant cross-border transaction either successful or unsuccessful and will deal with specific issues such as deal structuring, negotiating, and documenting that arose during the course of that deal. Past cases have included situations in the countries of China's banking, Burma & Thailand's energy, Philippines's industry privatization, Indonesia's real estate, and China's IPO."

All of the case studies are based on the Asia Pacific region and many recount trail-blazing deals that offer innovative and useful lessons for students. Among the principal topics examined in the course are: Entry Strategies; Negotiating Strategies; Pricing Strategies; and Strategies for dealing with Governments and State-Owned Enterprises. The course is taught from the perspective of management strategy and decision making, but it is intended also to sharpen students' capabilities in deal structuring, financing, negotiating, and solving regulatory issues. In several cases, students will be placed at the negotiating table and have the opportunity to test their strategy against the local counterparty. Actual transaction outcomes and subsequent events are always presented. Past cases have included situations in the countries of China's automotive and chemicals, Pan-Asia's the Internet, Thailand's aircraft, Taiwan's consumer goods, and Hong Kong's managing feng shui."

19305,GBUS,8424,001,Lecture,"1.5","","","","Games and Auctions","",Open,51,65,0,"This course aims to sharpen the participants' strategic thinking. It examines competitive situations from a diverse range of corporate activities in which performance depends on the interactions between a multiplicity of decision makers, including customers, suppliers, competitors, employees, managers, investors, and regulators. Students will develop a tool set for perceiving, analyzing, and shaping these interactions. Most of the tools have first been developed in economic game theory. Many key insights from game theory are intuitively compelling and fit literally on the back of an envelope. The course therefore emphasizes concepts and qualitative reasoning, rather than quantitative techniques. Case studies from different functional areas serve to provide students with a store of strategic insights and, under the guidance of analytical tools, to condition sound intuitive thinking that will carry over to new, unfamiliar problems. Computer simulations enable hands-on decision making and provide feedback on the effectiveness of personal rules of thumb for competitive interactions."

The primary purpose of the course is to teach students how to interpret and value the wide variety of derivatives products available. As such, the course examines a broad array of derivative products that range from basic futures contracts to the more specialized products developed for interest-rate markets. The valuation tools considered begin with basic arbitrage relationships and from there students will develop the Black-Scholes model. The course will also introduce the binomial approach and will use it as the primary valuation framework throughout the course. Students will also, through the use of assignments and problem sets, develop an intuitive understanding of why these products are used and the fundamental relationships that underlay all derivative products."

Building on the premise that entrepreneurship presents the best contemporary outlet for agents of revolutionary change, students will examine how enterprising individuals create value for themselves and others, across regional, industrial, and social boundaries. This is a course for those whose long-term goals extend beyond creating personal economic gain and involve creating broad-scale value for multiple stakeholders. Although this course does not guarantee that every student will become a change agent or provide a step-by-step path for executing such change, our belief is that the Washington, D.C. and Northern Virginia corridor as an intersection of technology, capital providers, government agencies and officials, small and large firms, and universities provides a fertile environment for study. Therefore, the course will be delivered in-residence in the Washington metropolitan area."

19261,GBUS,8428,001,Lecture,"1.5","","","","Securities Markets in Action","",Open,0,65,0,"Investment decision makers often experience a tension between the decision rules commonly found in practice and those proscribed in theory. The resolution of this tension creates a dilemma for investment professionals. Some may choose to blindly accept theory and ignore the real-world realities of the market place. Others may choose to casually dismiss financial theory as unrealistic and irrelevant. Because either of these responses is likely to be perilous, this course seeks to fill the need for a more balanced response. Students may begin the course understanding that traditional finance theory relies on a set of fundamental assumptions about the behavior of buyers and sellers of financial securities and conditions of the market in which they trade. This course surveys areas of common departure from the traditional assumptions of investor behavior and market conditions with a view to evaluating their impact on investment decision rules."
19262,GBUS,8429,001,Lecture,"1.5","","","","Managing Conflict and Leveraging Consensus","",Open,15,65,0,"This course will provide a deeper understanding of options, preferred approaches and best practices in managing conflict, and leveraging consensus. As conflict is an inevitable element in all human relations, students will explore how managers and leaders who effectively deal with both daily and systemic conflict enjoy a distinct competitive advantage in a variety of respects. These include: building and maintaining strategic alliances and networks; furthering team creativity and innovation; fostering collaborative organizational cultures and working relationships; containing financial and human costs; and, ultimately, improving business results. While rooted in negotiation and conflict theory, this course will provide pragmatic and practical general management skills and should therefore be of interest to all students, regardless of their specific career or personal goals. Bargaining and Negotiating is a prerequisite for this course. Principal modes of instruction are cases, readings, extended simulations, and in-class exercises."

The course also explores the management of businesses with a creative component, including topics such as how to deal effectively with advertising, public relations, or a talent agency, and better understanding those within an organization who create intellectual property (e.g., engineers designing cars and scientists researching breakthroughs in biotechnology). Students will discuss the challenges of communicating across boundaries to bridge the gap between the perceived 'creative' and 'business' functions. Cases studies will be utilized as well as projects designed either by the students themselves in a way that is helpful to their career or by guests involved in the course. The course will also stage creative encounters in which guests involved in media, entertainment, and sports engage students in the problems they face in their professional lives, encounters for which students will aim to find innovative solutions."

Students will examine the ways marketing experiences are altering the methods with which companies create demand, the role of mass customization in shifting from goods and services to experiences, and how the staging of experiences requires fundamentally different human performance technologies. Students also will participate in a comprehensive review of nine analytical models. Each model is designed to foster robust thinking about experiential innovation and will be accompanied by a handful of typical examples, followed by open discussion and an interactive exercise aimed at making application to specific businesses and industries. At the conclusion of this review, teams will be formed with each team tasked with developing a case study or research report that utilizes a particular model to provide further exploration about creating value through new or enhanced experiences."

It focuses on how leaders can construct environments that encourage employees to search for innovative ways to improve the competitiveness of the enterprise, on a daily basis without external direction and instruction, and how these environments (cultures) can guide both strategic and executive decisions to optimize enterprise performance. It also demonstrates why innovation is increasingly important, not only to technology companies but also to companies across a broad spectrum of industries. Through business cases and filmed interviews, students will examine companies and leaders that have been successful at building cultures of innovation. The course is intended for students who seek to lead a business organization. It may also be useful for students wishing to pursue an investment career, as identifying leadership that creates cultures of innovation is believed by many to be a key ingredient in successful investing.

On the contrary, it deals with companies operating in the mundane, real world of the typical small-enterprise owner who needs sales to meet the payroll, wisely uses limited capital resources, carefully raises new funds, and must plan for the ultimate transfer of the business to new owners. The latter problem is unique to the small, privately held business. In addition to considering typical issues of asset management, including acquisitions and dispositions, the course will cover topics such as working-capital management, selecting funding sources and structuring loans, project finance, creating liquidity, and transferring the business to the next generation or selling it.

The course emphasizes the tactical aspects of business marketing as well as conceptual and strategic elements of the marketing-planning process. The course begins by examining how to organize the marketing function and then moves to the topics of buyer-seller relationships, sales force management, complexities and problems inherent in forging longer term partnerships, and developing and managing complex distribution systems along with some exposure to product development and launch. Cases have been chosen from a variety of settings, ranging from high tech to 'metal bending' and from the emerging to the more mature businesses. As opportunities arise, the course will incorporate a 'live' case. Working with a company to address critical marketing problems, student teams will be assigned to work on these problems.

The name of the course accurately describes its contents: strategic management of organizations that create and deliver financial products. There are several reasons for studying the strategic management challenges of financial service organizations. First, this aspect of financial service organizations management has been the make-or-break decision for financial service organizations in recent years. Some segments of the financial service industry end up with capital needs, and others find themselves with surplus but expensive capital. Either problem can be fatal. Once the strategy has been selected, however, the implementation decisions, although not necessarily the implementation itself, are comparatively straightforward. Second, the strategic perspective permits the course much broader scope than would the alternative of concentrating in depth on a narrower set of institutions in order to cover all aspects of management. Broad perspective is also important for the course to make the maximum contribution to the career decisions of students considering jobs with financial service organizations, institutions that are not as closely examined in the corporate-finance focus of the first-year curriculum."

Students will have the opportunity to reflect on their own values and ethics as well as examine and build upon their own definition of leadership. Each session will be devoted to a different leader, focusing on their background, context, and type of leadership they displayed. Insights from these leaders and an array of readings on leadership will be used to foster reflection on what makes a great leader. The majority of leaders chosen for study, although familiar, are not business entrepreneurs or leaders of large corporations. The idea is to think more broadly about what makes great leadership by looking at a series of figures who offer a range of approaches to leadership and the value systems that can underlie it. Some leaders covered in past courses were Sir Ernest Shackleton, George Patton, Chairman Mao, Oscar Schindler, Mahatma Gandhi, Margaret Thatcher, Martin Luther King, Jr., Mustafa Ataturk, Al Groh, Cynthia Cooper, Ann Fudge, and Muhammad Yunus. Our focus will be on these leaders, their stories, and how they connect values and leadership, but at the end of each study students will connect the discussions back to the present and their challenges as future leaders."

During the course, topics such as gender, race, meanings, habits of excellence, relationships, creativity, and life-long growth will be examined.

It covers selected strategy topics in depth that are chosen from three areas: First Year Strategy, current practice and issues, and current research in strategy and related fields of economics and organizational sociology. Four streams of literature will be discussed: organizational economics, resource-based/dynamic-capabilities view of the firm, business psychology, and business sociology. The course will allow students to become more conversant with relevant current issues in strategic thinking and the practice of strategy and to treat ideas in greater depth and rigor than possible in a traditional case course. Through this dialogue, students will sharpen their strategic thinking abilities and instincts. The course content will consist of a variety of readings from books, management and academic journals, and working papers. Class meets once a week, and the reading load is extensive. Grading will be based on class participation, weekly one-page papers, and a final essay."

Most class sessions revolve around the results of negotiations between class members that are conducted prior to class, as preparation for the session. The results of these negotiations are displayed each day and provide an opportunity for explicit feedback on each student's negotiating performance. Class discussion reviews the wide variety of experiences in the specific negotiation and develops and tests hypotheses regarding effective behaviors, tactics, and strategies. The resulting ideas are reinforced and further developed through a series of weekly readings. Finally, the course offers several frameworks for codifying each student's negotiation toolkit and for describing each student's negotiation behavior."
